I am the Winner for Ireland of Speaker Factor 2021 for the Professional Speaking Association.\\xa0\\xa0üèÜMy talk only took 5 minutes, but those 5 minutes were packed with the generosity, experience and expertise of too many people to name.\\xa0\\xa0My fabulous work wife Sarah Travers, my client Brian Law and all of my family and friends stepped up.\\xa0They‚Äôre there for me always and any time I ask.\\xa0And from within PSA, an organisation that I only joined six months ago I am humbled at the generosity of those PSA members that shared their time and experience.  Jackie Handy FPSA FREC and Eamonn O'Brien, Next-Level Business Storytelling Expert are legends.\\xa0And Steve Bustin‚Äôs Critique Club is something I would recommend to anyone looking for robust feedback to develop as a speaker.\\xa0For her encouragement and support, PSA Ireland‚Äôs Denise Fay - Community Builder has been the rock that kept us all together.\\xa0And for THE conversation that started it all off, I‚Äôm very grateful to Amy Rowlinson.To the rock that she‚Äôs become in my life, my fabulous PSA accountability buddy, Eileen Fleming, Thank You!! Eileen and I met for the first time in January at PSA Ireland and we now meet every single week to keep one another accountable for our goals and ambitions.\\xa0I was one of an amazing line-up of Speaker Factor contestants. If you‚Äôre in the business of organising events, I recommend you connect with them. There was powerful emotion and advice and life experiences being shared in the room ‚Äì your audiences will be moved.\\xa0Aisling Brennan Denise Brannick Jean Evans - Networking Architect Aoife Gaffney Patrick Mercie Kate Rooney  The OnLegs Agency Liz ValloorWhat an experience.\\xa0\\xa0My biggest takeaway was managing performance anxiety, so I updated my blog with what I learnt.\\xa0I hope that you might find an idea that helps you the next time you decide to step up and do something that scares you‚Ä¶..\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Link in the comments belowHave a great week.Paul Davis - Life Purpose and Business Coach Andrew Dobbin Colm O'Brien Lynda Shaw Barbara Moynihan Stuart Harris Andy Lopata #publicspeaking #presentationskills\",\n",

       "  'Content': \"Three months into my new role at Transport for NSW and I have embarked on maternity leave. Commencing a new role six months pregnant was a daunting prospect but my Executive Director and team have been incredibly supportive from the get go. From day one, I have been congratulated on my pregnancy and flooded with support. I have loved every second in my new role and relish the opportunity to positively impact our customers every day. I have never felt so motivated and whilst I'm looking forward to a few months off with this little guy, I am eager to return & make a difference. A shout out to Transport for NSW and my Maritime team for welcoming me so openly. I feel fortunate to encounter an employer who doesn't just talk diversity & inclusion but lives it. My experience has taught me that pregnancy shouldn't hinder your career. If you are expectant and considering changing roles or a promotion - take the plunge! And if you're looking for a challenging and rewarding career, in an organisation that fosters career progression, development and flexibility, I highly recommend Transport for NSW.#transportfornsw #nswmaritimeMark Hutchings Yvonne Hughes\",\n",
