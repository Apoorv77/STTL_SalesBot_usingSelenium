"Things VCs will want to know before they invest in your company:VCs want you to demonstrate that there's a big market for what you're selling, and big bucks being spent in that market.VCs want you to be able to explain how you are going to use their money.VCs will want to know about the market for the product or service you're selling.
More than that, they will want to know that it's a big market.Why? VCs are in it to help you grow, and big markets support growth.Not only are big markets more stable and less inclined to volatility, they are also able to support the operations of multiple growing companies.
And if the market is growing, even better. That will give you a tail wind.On the flip side, if the market you work in is too small, there may not be room for enough growth for the investor to get a return on his or her investment.VCs want you to show how your product is different from what's out there. What makes it unique?There are several ways to stand out.Product differentiation: You've got something completely different (and hard to replicate).Process differentiation: You are selling a new, more efficient way of doing things.Price point differentiation: You have found a way to sell a product or service for less or for more (i.e. premium pricing).Super niche differentiation: You've found a market that's a particularly good fit for you.The Five Cs are:1. CMRR, ARR, & ARRR â€“ Committed monthly recurring revenue, annual recurring revenue, and annual run rate revenue; 2. Cash flow â€“ Start with gross burn rate and net burn rate, then hopefully turn to free cash flow over time; 3. CAC â€“ Customer acquisition cost payback period. 4. CLTV â€“ Customer lifetime value. 5. Churn & renewal rates â€“ Logo churn, CMRR churn and CMRR renewed. Investors simply looking for a return often develop a philosophy nonetheless â€“ usually around their past ability to pick winners.

"6 months into the year - 12 months into Gorillas... After reviewing Gorillas Q2, I am proud of how my team constructs this beautiful business and felt like sharing some of the milestones ????

THANK YOU goes to the communities forming Gorillas’ core: employees, customers, partners, suppliers and investors. Without the strong communities, hitting these milestones would not have been possible.

I want to moonwalk when I think about Q2 - it was a quarter that my young, dedicated & cohesive team laser focused on attraction in the presence of distraction. Here's Gorillas Q2

?? We have delivered over 2.5M orders with an average delivery time of 10.8 minutes, always #fasterthanyou
??????? The bike crew covered distances that amount to riding 161 times around the world on bikes - wow! 
?? Our crew grew by 6000 new team members in Q2 alone, this is more than 65 new members starting every day 
?? We grew together: 400+ former riders changed roles within Gorillas through our internal career development program
?? Immediate access to essential needs in more places: in Q2, we’ve launched 5 new countries and 39 new cities 
?? We’ve developed our very own rider app, picker app, warehouse management software and rolling it out to more warehouses every day
?? We mapped every single process in the business, I mean it by every single :) & built our knowledge base enabling our constant improvement ambition

?? And my personal highlight: In a time of supersonic growth, Gorillas scored an employee happiness score of 8,6/10 - culture, work environment and people being the main drivers behind the number

This list covers three months of Gorillas - looking at it, I am beyond excited by the progress we’re making & beyond proud to feel it's the first day everyday. Ready for whatever the rest of 2021 might bring ???? #alwaysberiding

"The BMA’s recent update has sparked fury across healthcare.

Are walk-in GP appointments really not safe?

Recently, the BMA announced something that has landed it in controversy.

They said:

That poor ventilation-

Means walk-in GP appointments are not safe for patients.

The risk of COVID is just too high.

Critics have claimed that:

Consulting patients over Zoom would lead to more people diagnosed later than normal.

This comes on the back of the recent NHS mandate:

That all patients have the right to see their family doctor in person.

Karol Sikora, a medical expert, said:

‘It makes sense if the NHS is in crisis but the crisis has gone now.’

I personally believe a hybrid system for consultations would be a better idea.

But what about you:

Do you think walk-in GP appointments are safe for patients?

Looking for a remote patient consultation platform that’s not a one-size-fits-all tool?

"Back in February, I set my countdown clock to wind down a career that spanned a wonderful 33 years at Easter Seals Ontario and RBC. At RBC, 25 years and ten roles later, I have had a full career with so many opportunities to meet and learn from numerous leaders and peers, inside and outside of the bank. It’s been a privilege to be trusted several times over to lead teams and be a mentor. I’ve also had the opportunity to volunteer at organizations like Ascend Canada and March of Dimes, and with more free time coming up, I’m looking forward to pouring more energy into the causes so dear to me. These last 33 years wouldn’t be even remotely possible without the support of my wife, Jayshri and my daughters, Vanisha and Veena. They have been with me through the lows and highs and always believed and stood by me. I cannot thank them enough. If I’ve learned anything over these years – and I’ve been asked a few times since the countdown clock began – here are a few principles I’ve lived by for life and career: ·      “Think like a shareholder” is one of my go-to pieces of advice. If you put the company first over any person, line of business, or platform, you will consistently make the right decisions.    ·      For your career: your manager is the most important person in your network and don’t underestimate the power of a development plan. ·      Be generous with your time to others, volunteer and give back to your cause or community – and don’t expect anything in return. More than anything, I’ll look back at my time with RBC and Easter Seals and remember all the colleagues that became friends and the many things that we achieved together -- far too many to list (nor do I want to miss any!). I will forever be indebted to all of you for the experiences and conversations we shared.  Thank you for making my life richer and I hope our paths cross again. Until then, stay safe and healthy. ",0

"It really saddens me when I hear of people being forced back into the office because it suits their employers. Haven’t people proved themselves this past 18 months? Traditionally home working or remote working as we now call it was always for the lucky few. And by lucky few you had to have had an illustrious career with lots of rewards or grafted your proverbial ‘nuts’ off to massively overachieve every single KPI & then some. Just to prove you were worthy enough or should I say trusted enough to work from home. Fast forward to 2020 when the pandemic hit & the Government forced businesses to allow their staff to work from home. With little notice & in a lot of cases very little support, your staff went home & did their jobs. Often juggling their work load with home schooling their kids & often looking out for sick family members. How working parents have survived this last year is nothing short of herculean. Yet here we are 18 months later telling people they have to come back. Telling them they can’t have a blended return to the office. Telling them they can’t take annual leave. Telling them they can’t go on the holiday thats been moved 3 times already because the Government changed their destination to amber. It’s not fair, it’s not supportive & it’s not really justifiable. A massive shift has taken place, people have been through so much during this time. They know they won’t get this time back with their families, & they know they can do their job no matter where they are & what life throws at them. So please, stop putting people under more pressure & stress just because it’s suits you. You are creating a toxic workplace & you will loose good people. Let me know your thoughts on this? Have you heard any examples of this from friends or colleagues?",0

"The amount of remote jobs is growing, but the number of people looking for these jobs is growing faster.

The good news for remote job seekers: Employers are starting to realize that offering remote positions is a good way to compete and attract the best talent.

Companies are also starting to offer remote roles for lower-level positions, so you no longer need to be as experienced to land a remote role.

However, there are still far more job seekers wanting remote roles than actual remote roles.

So if you want a remote position you need to get creative in how you approach these companies. Networking and approaching hiring managers directly is essential.

For anyone interested in the trends and topic, I recommend the article below. It was an interesting read.",0
"Goodbyes are hard, and June has been full of them for me. I left two jobs that I loved this month. I’m excited to post about the incredible opportunity I accepted, but today I wanted to just share kudos about the awesome places I sadly had to leave to make it happen. mBank will always hold a special place in my heart. Because of my roots in Manistique/Marquette, it is full of countless former classmates, colleagues, and neighbors. My first day with Katy bringing me around to introduce me to everyone, I already knew most of them! Funny enough, the one department that I didn’t know anyone was IT. That quickly changed as everyone went from strangers to the best “work family” I’ve had. I can’t thank Jake enough for giving me the opportunity. I can’t thank Ryan enough for being the best mentor/safety net/partner-in-crime. CJ, Hillary, Jer, Joshua, Kurt, and Myra— I’ll miss you all. Leaving was heartbreaking. Acquisitions are a reality of banking, and change is part of that. For many non-customer facing roles, this meant frank discussions about moving. I have found that us Yoopers are hard-headed about many things, and one of them is leaving the UP. We’re all here for a reason, be it family, nature, or just the fact that it’s “home.” I wish those who are able to stay on the very best. I know for myself and many of my peers, seeking local or remote roles was the right choice for us and our families. Which brings me to Hagerty. I was thrilled to accept an offer to stay in the UP and remotely join their Incident Response team. My recruiting process with Tiffany was amazing. Hagerty has received national “Best Workplaces” accolades, and it’s easy to see why. Their embrace of remote work shows what a forward-thinking organization they are and the talent they’ve built is staggering. Once I was able to meet the Security team, and especially my manager and peers in IR, to say I was blown away would be an understatement. Knowing I found a place I could be happy after mBank was a relief. I envisioned a long future there— but life happens. Before the ink was even dry on my offer letter, I received an opportunity that is a huge leap for my career and my family. If you want to see the character of an organization, look at how they respond to tough news. Every single person I dealt with understood/supported my decision, even in the face of a difficult situation. To any of my contacts looking for work— this place is the real deal. Check out their open positions and follow them for future roles— they’re growing fast. Leaving there on such short notice was one of the hardest decisions of my professional life. In the near future, I’ll update my LinkedIn and post about my new role, but I wanted to take the time today to just thank these two incredible organizations. Wishing everyone at mBank and Hagerty the best, and glad to have crossed paths with all of you. Great people make the best workplaces what they are, and both places are overflowing with great peopl",0

"Did you know that nearly 50% of employers that #outsource say the quality of their #service providers and a reactive versus proactive attitude is the most frustrating issues to deal with?

And how important the #team you are hiring is?

If you didn’t have to take the #PRICE under consideration when outsourcing a part of your work - who would you hire?

Don’t choose your outsourcing team based on their price (whether it’s a lower or a higher one - it doesn’t determine the quality of anyone’s work) choose it based on their experience.

Your #team should be:

1) Proactive;
2) Able to face the changes and challenges and adjust to them fast;
3) Reliable;
4) Experienced;
5) Willing to learn;
6) Ambitious;
7) Able to nurture your companies values just like it was their own;
8) Creative;
9) Able to act quickly!
10) RELIABLE!

Ask for a testimonial. Ask for proof that justifies the price. Talk to their previous clients. See if your energies align. Don't forget - the outsourcing team is there to take a part of the burden off your back, not the ones who will add to that cargo and make it even more difficult.

If you’re looking to outsource Lead Gen as part of your offering, if you would like to include it into your sales cycle or if you know anyone who is looking to outsource - DM me!",0

"We take a look at an article on why npm audit is broken, check out the AppSumo 2 day sale, a new query language for Wikipedia, look at some important changes to Git and why not, I struggle through the JS is weird test with you.

NPM and the Boy Who Cried Wolf

NPM, the tool that is installed with NodeJS...which most web developers use everyday has a false positive approach that creates a 'boy who cried wolf' problem. This great article from Dan Abramov is a deep dive into why that's a problem and potential fixes.

AppSumo Day Sale

This is a limited time deal, but the site is always awesome. AppSumo has a lot of up and coming apps often offered with lifetime deals. I've found so many useful apps here like Publr and Switchy. They have some specials that are set to last only for a couple of days.

Wikipedia QL

This npm project is a tool for querying Wikipedia. It's a NodeJS module that uses the Wikipedia API to retrieve metadata in an easy to digest JSON format. It runs on and returns easy to part JSON data. I like that at the end of the NPM project it shows some reasons why this is a better approach than other solutions provide by and for Wikipedia.

Git Restore and Switch

There's been some recent changes to Git, the most popular version control system for web developers. The git checkout command had been doing the work of switching to commits and branches as well as restoring the state of commits. That work has now been split into two different commands, git restore and git switch.

JS is Weird

I'm not big on quizzes...they bring back old memories of bad teachers, but I really think you should take this quiz. It's full of questions about JavaScript's quirkiness, so this isn't about learning useful code for your next project. and the best part of the quiz is not the questions, but at the end, the site provides thorough explanations of why the developer chose to write his own query language.",0

A month ago, I got selected for Microsoft Engage Mentorship Program 2021. Under this program, we had to build a Microsoft Teams Clone with 1:1 video calling as a mandatory feature.

"Today I’m delighted and excited to say I’m retiring.

Last week I resigned from Cloudflare, a truely great company and one I would not leave to join any other in this industry right now. I had a short but enjoyable stay there and would recommend them, both as an employer and a vendor, to anyone.

However, if this last 18 months has taught us anything it’s that if you have plans, you’d best get on with them, as you never know what’s round the corner! Dianne and I have lots of plans so……

I’ve been very fortuante in my career to work for some great companies and I’ve worked with, and learnt from, many talented people along the way.

Those who know me well will know that personal relationships and the social aspect of work has been very important to me. I’ve been lucky enough to make many friends along the way. One of my goals in retirement is to catch up personally with many who I haven’t see for a while. Look out you may be on my hit list??

This industry and the people in it have given me so much over the years and I’ll always be grateful to those who’ve helped me along the way. It’s also been fun, so thanks to all the fellow party animals out there to. It’s been a blast!

I have many plans for retirement including getting my golf handicap down, some serious travelling when things settle down, and moving down to Cornwall early next year with Dianne. The party animal theme will, of couse, continue unabated ??

Good luck to you all, and I hope to cross paths again with many of you in the near future.

Stay healthy and happy",0
"I just got an email from Crunchbase letting me know that I can use them for contact data, which is already a crowded (but somewhat dissatisfying) space.

Here are my issues:

?? The OGs like ZoomInfo and Clearbit are too enterprise for a little founder like me (the lack of public pricing is a dead giveaway).

????? I've tried RocketReach.co and Lusha.com, but you burn through the 5 free contacts pretty instantaneously and then you need to buy 100+ credits per month, which I'm reluctant to do because the data quality is often kind of spotty (previous jobs don't count!). I've liked Wiza for scraping a LinkedIn list, but it's not as handy for one-off lookups.

With that wind-up, here are my questions:

1) To the sales development leaders out there--what are the best tools and best practices for small sales teams (bigger than just founders, but not massive sales teams)? Looking at you Chris Flores, Jason Bay, Armand Farrokh, Sarah Brazier

2) On the scrappier side, what do you recommend for founders who sell? Would love your take Peter Kazanjy, Rob Walling.

"We hear a lot of chatter in business and society today pertaining to respecting people, but so much of it is just frivolous words that vaporize quickly.

“Respect for People” extends to employees, customers and suppliers in a way where everyone’s position and situation is important when changes or improvements are being considered.

It’s not about mandating some ‘secret sauce’ software solution or management initiative that creates grief for the end-users!

Everyone must benefit from the change! It cannot be just some half-baked initiative/idea coming from one group/department that needs to hit some silly internal goal, without respecting the other people who may be negatively affected.

Begin by asking this question: “Are our customers, employees and suppliers penalized by the recommended changes?”",0

"Overthinking, crippling nerves, sick stomach - all the symptoms of a fear of public speaking ??And the last month has given me an overdose of all of these. You see in January I decided 2021 was the year to move my public speaking to the next level. So I joined the Professional Speaking Association to give me the push I needed. And every year the PSA runs the prestigious #SpeakerFactor competition, the annual hunt for emerging professional speakers.  So this weekend I stepped up to the challenge and put myself on a (virtual) stage in front of an audience of professional speakers – folk that make their living from keynote speeches delivered all over the world. Way out of my comfort zone ??And yes, I will write it down. I won! I am the Winner for Ireland of Speaker Factor 2021 for the Professional Speaking Association.  ??My talk only took 5 minutes, but those 5 minutes were packed with the generosity, experience and expertise of too many people to name.  My fabulous work wife Sarah Travers, my client Brian Law and all of my family and friends stepped up. They’re there for me always and any time I ask. And from within PSA, an organisation that I only joined six months ago I am humbled at the generosity of those PSA members that shared their time and experience.  Jackie Handy FPSA FREC and Eamonn O'Brien, Next-Level Business Storytelling Expert are legends. And Steve Bustin’s Critique Club is something I would recommend to anyone looking for robust feedback to develop as a speaker. For her encouragement and support, PSA Ireland’s Denise Fay - Community Builder has been the rock that kept us all together. And for THE conversation that started it all off, I’m very grateful to Amy Rowlinson.To the rock that she’s become in my life, my fabulous PSA accountability buddy, Eileen Fleming, Thank You!! Eileen and I met for the first time in January at PSA Ireland and we now meet every single week to keep one another accountable for our goals and ambitions. I was one of an amazing line-up of Speaker Factor contestants. If you’re in the business of organising events, I recommend you connect with them. There was powerful emotion and advice and life experiences being shared in the room – your audiences will be moved. Aisling Brennan Denise Brannick Jean Evans - Networking Architect Aoife Gaffney Patrick Mercie Kate Rooney  The OnLegs Agency Liz ValloorWhat an experience.  My biggest takeaway was managing performance anxiety, so I updated my blog with what I learnt. I hope that you might find an idea that helps you the next time you decide to step up and do something that scares you…..   Link in the comments belowHave a great week.Paul Davis - Life Purpose and Business Coach Andrew Dobbin Colm O'Brien Lynda Shaw Barbara Moynihan Stuart Harris Andy Lopata #publicspeaking #presentationskills",0

As of today I've been on the team with Gregory Ritchie, Jessica Gilmore, and Heather McGuigan for one week and I can honestly say this is one of the best moves I could have made both personally and professionally. I never thought I would leave the nonprofit world. I attended Drury University originally thinking I would work for an arts organization. Then, when I got my Master of Arts, I realized I could work wherever I would be deeply passionate about the mission. I found that at Habitat for Humanity of Springfield, Missouri. I truly loved the nearly seven (7!!) years I spent there. I knew that when I left the nonprofit industry it was imperative that I find a career that still allows me to give back to Springfield. Central Bank does exactly that. I knew the impact before, but now I see the impact. I can't wait to dive deeper and learn more about our community involvement!It's still early so I honestly don't know much about business banking, but I would love to meet with you over a cup of coffee or lunch to learn more about your business!

"*Book recommendation* Bomber Mafia, by Malcom Gladwell.I was surprised how engrossing this book is. Although I like reading about military strategy, air power was never a topic that particularly interested me (hence, not a a pilot). But, Gladwell expertly tells the story of aerial bombing vs precision bombing, tying it to morality in war. Few strategists other than the Bomber Mafia Air Force generals saw air power for what it truly was during WWII- a capability able to drive strategic decisions in the war, including the end of WWII with the aerial dropping of nuclear bombs. Today there is no debate about how important controlling the air is. We use precision guided munitions in a plethora of military operations. Throughout the book I couldn’t help but compare air power in the first half of the 1900s to Information Warfare today (includes cyber, artificial intelligence, and all things extremely high-tech). As we continue to develop, hone, and demonstrate the power of Information Warfare, I look forward to it also becoming an intrinsic part of every military operation.  In ~20 years there will be a sequel called “Information Warfare Mafia”.",0

"Last week I celebrated my eleven-year work anniversary which has made me a bit reflective. I have been thinking a lot about my journey over the past eleven years and about the concept of change. In 2010 I was a teacher looking for a career transformation, and at the recommendation of a great friend, I took a leap of faith with Aerotek. A whole lot has happened since then… I’ve become a wife and a mother (twice) within my time here. I have taken on six different roles over the years, along the way supporting several different regions, divisions, and business units. Today, I technically work for a completely different company (still under the Allegis umbrella) reporting into an incredible Corporate team. I’ve had the opportunity to travel to so many places and partner with so many incredibly talented individuals. I’ve made a ton of amazing friends and memories along the way. I don’t take for granted the personal and professional growth that has been fueled by being pushed, challenged, and supported over the past eleven years. I didn’t choose Aerotek in 2010 because of the name of the company. I chose our company because of what it stands for and because of the people. I chose this company for the opportunity to grow, and to have the privilege to develop others. All of that still stands true as I now support Actalent, an Engineering & Sciences services and talent solutions company.

"When life took a left turn in March and we quickly relocated to Las Vegas for my wife's once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, I realized I was going to have some time on my hands before I went back to work. I decided to get my CFI FMVA certification as a way to both pass the time and sharpen my skillset. I would recommend the program to anyone looking to advance their career or gain deeper knowledge in a broad range of finance related topics. #finance #financialmodeling #career #microsoftexcel",0
"Yesterday I shared the SBOM Minimum Elements publication from US Department of Commerce, NTIAContinuing on with the theme of Software Supply Chain Security, per the Cyber EO, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) along with the National Security Agency were tasked with publishing guidelines recommending minimum standards for vendors' testing of their software code. Those guidelines are now published in the attached ""Guidelines on Minimum Standards for Developer Verification of Software"" The document describes eleven recommendations for software verification techniques. These include:- Threat modeling to look for design-level security issues- Automated testing for consistency and to minimize human effort- Static code scanning to look for top bugs- Heuristic tools to look for possible hardcoded secrets- Use of build-in checks and protections- ""Black box"" test cases- Code-based structural test cases- Historical test cases- Fuzzing- Web app scanners, if applicable- Address included code (libraries, packages, services) ""To ensure that software is sufficiently safe and secure, software must be designed, built, delivered, and maintained well. Frequent and thorough verification by developers as early as possible in the software development life cycle (SDLC) is one critical element of software security assurance.""#ciso #infosec #security #cyber #cybersecurity #publicsector #software #sdlc #devsecops #nationalsecurity #technology #softwaredevelopment #incidentresponse",0

For those wondering about AI & scary robots, what we talked about was primarily the responsible development of AI on our missions. And this partnership embodies that by placing a very diverse & inclusive group of handpicked servicemembers here on campus, side-by-side with many of the foremost leaders in the fields of computational science & AI, to work on projects that matter. It tangibly represents a deep commitment to responsible AI, the thoughtful use of it by our Air and Space professionals, and ensures we are operating today with tomorrow in mind.

"#Learnlooklocate. KNOW YOUR #Genetic Risk!https://bit.ly/3eoKoTE Meet Sammie! She has the BRCA1 gene-she now has Stage IV #Breastcancer. She is a FIGHTER! Her story is going to help so many #people become more educated on the POWER of #genetictesting  and how it can help save a #life! Her BRCA 1 gene came from her father, but her dad was not aware that he had the gene until Sammie's diagnosis. Her dad now has Stage IV #pancreaticcancer  due to the BRCA1 gene. Her identical twin also has the #BRCA1 gene and because of Sammie's #diagnosis, her sister was proactive and got a double #mastectomy . Sammie's #family  has been touched by the BRCA gene in so many ways which is why together we want to share her story to help EDUCATE the world on how important it is to know your genetic risk!Genetic testing can help #doctors look for missing or defective genes. This information helps them know if a person, their partner, or #family member is likely to have certain medical conditions. Genetic testing is offered to those who are likely to have an inherited mutation based on personal or family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer. If a gene mutation is detected, you and your doctor can work together to manage your risk. Normally, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes protect you from getting certain cancers. But certain mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes prevent them from working properly, so that if you inherit one of these mutations, you are more likely to get breast, ovarian, and other cancers. You and your family members are more likely to have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation if your family has a strong history of breast or #ovariancancer. #Researchers are continuing to study gene mutations that increase the risk of cancer and developing new #gene tests. If your gene test was done more than five years ago, your #doctor  might recommend testing again as newer tests continue to come out. The BRCA gene test is a #bloodtest  that uses #DNA analysis to identify harmful changes (mutations) in either one of the two breast cancer susceptibility genes — BRCA1 and BRCA2.People who inherit mutations in these genes are at an increased risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer compared with the general population. https://mayocl.in/3kmHi6I#women #jewish #connections #anxiety #oncology #immunotherapy #healthcare #radiation #depression",0
"TGIF Linked fam! I just got two more awesome recommendations I have to share: ""Tyson is by far the best recruiter I’ve ever worked with. He was very upfront and honest while helping me elevate in my career. I was previously underpaid for my experience and after working with Tyson he helped me land a dream job and compensation. He’s very professional and also relatable. I truly feel like I’ve developed a connection with Tyson that will last a lifetime. I highly recommend others to give him a shot and watch him work his magic."" Thanks Aaron! And this one: ""I had the pleasure of working with Tyson this summer for a Biotech expansion role. From the very start he was incredibly professional, insightful, and reliable. He is by far one of the best recruiters I have ever worked with. Even though I was in Arizona and he was in Tennessee, Tyson always made time to answer all of my questions, hop on a phone call, and prep me for each stage in the interview process. It takes a special kind of person to create such a high level of trust, confidence, and support from across the country. I hold Tyson in high regard and wholeheartedly recommend that anyone looking for a new career opportunity should reach out to him immediately.""

"Hiring your first VP of ESG to launch your ESG strategy? Looking for a ESG Impact Reporting Director to get your ESG disclosures in shape for regulators and investors?  So are 100s of other global companies. As an experienced executive of both an enterprise ESG strategy and a Green Financing business, here are my top 5 recommendations for hiring your first ESG leader - and how to ensure their and your company's success in the long-term: 1. Teamwork makes the (ESG) dreamwork: Hiring a leader is a great first step to kicking off your organization's first ESG strategy. But they can't do it alone. They will need two additional teams to ensure their and your organization's long-term success with ESG: a dedicated team to develop and execute the ESG strategy and a dedicated cross-functional advisory council with defined responsibilities to support the new ESG leader and strategy. 2. Link ESG and the core business at the hip: An ESG strategy doesn't exist in a vacuum, and it can't succeed without being embedded in a business' core products and services. Your Head of Business Line A and Head of Business Line B may not be sustainability leaders, but they will need to partner with your EVP/SVP/VP of ESG to create the business value for your company. 3. You're hiring a change management leader not just a technical green guru: Your new ESG leader will know (or should know!) the in's and out's of all the ESG acronyms including UNSDGs, PRI, GHG, LCA, TCFD, SASB and more. But you should also be hiring for a leader who will be able to navigate and lead fundamental changes in your business and culture.  4. Don't leave the new ESG leader flapping in the wind: On the note of change management, it's hard. Integrating ESG and sustainability principles is tough and perhaps even tougher than ""traditional"" changes implemented at a company since there is a new language and even a new belief system to adopt. Whether you're hiring internally or externally, make sure you, the CEO, the CFO and even up to the Board, back-up the new leader especially when they face headwinds.Last but not least: 5. Give the leader - and your organization - time to succeed with ESG: You can absolutely get your first ESG report out and respond to MSCI, Sustainalytics and other ESG rating agency surveys within the first year of the new ESG leader taking on the role. However, setting ambitious long-term ESG goals grounded in a deep understanding of your current baseline will take much longer. Shifting core products to generate real, defensible, positive environmental and social impact (plus financial value!) will not be realized until at least year three or longer.  Follow me for more insights on ESG + business leadership. Send me a LinkedIn message if you need help launching your ESG strategy and team. #ESG #sustainability #changemanagement #leadership #culture #business #esgintegration",0

"You may have seen many researchers who are very talented, yet, not very productive. It is because there are many factors that play in success of a researcher in addition to talent. Amongst others, academic environment plays an integral role. Some of the important steps that can help in developing a significant healthy academic environment are;1. In postgraduate research, one needs to be critical and should develop a skill of looking at a phenomena from different viewpoints. I will recommend something which I did not really observe during my PhD in Malaysia. It is really awesome to surround yourselves by other fellow researchers on a daily basis. Have healthy discussions on different ideas. This can help you learn and look at things from various perspectives. It can also help you facing critique on your work and how to be critical on others’ work. 2. During my time in UK and US, I have observed that people from a department meet for coffee every day either in on-campus coffee shops or in the designated discussion areas in the departments. Researchers (PhD candidates and young faculty members) throw their ideas around and ask questions. People take an interest in others’ research and help each other out. I have seen great collaborative work originating from these coffee table discussions.3. Courage is another important part of a healthy academic environment. One must be courageous to admit that s/he lack certain skills or does not know the answer. One must show courage to ask questions either from their seniors or their supervisors. Remember, that great scholarly works originate from one silly idea.4. Except for a very few Universities, most of the universities does not have extensive coursework for PhD students. As a result, PhD students do not interact with one another. It is very important for the grooming of researchers to have informal interaction sessions once a week or once in two weeks. Remember, that most of the PhD students make a big mistake by trying to do everything on their own and never discuss their ideas with others including their supervisors.Considering all of these points, ask yourself if you have a healthy academic environment in your department. If not, are you willing to create one? Believe me, it has wonderful results.As always, good luck and God bless you all.Follow me on https://lnkd.in/g8jAzrf #researchbeast",0

You have represented BCU exceptionally well.  Colleagues across BCU: Thank you for encouraging students and graduates to participate in this programme, for registering as mentors yourselves and for helping to build our mentor pool through your networks.

"#TechTipsWithDevinApp technology tip this week! I wanted to share a new app I started using this week (thank you Steven Quagliero for recommending) called CamCard. This app is perfect for people (like myself) who hate uploading 20+ business cards into the CRM after an event. With the app you are able to scan the business card and it will read all the information on the card. Then, you can upload all of the contact information into a csv. file that you can import into your CRM. With the basic account you can scan up to 500 cards and there is also a premium option available to export directly to CRM. This is a great technology tool for anyone in sales, business development, or anyone just looking to find any easier way to manage their networking. Happy Wednesday to all!#sales #business #technology #businessdevelopment #networking #software #crm #apptechnology",0

"Putting climate at the top of the ESG Pyramid This thought-provoking piece does a good job of addressing one of the key questions swirling around the ESG space. ""Does mitigating the climate crisis trump all other global financial issues?""  My opinion, a resounding yes. Let’s face it, if we fail to solve the climate challenge, then Life on Land (UN SDG#15) and Life Below Water (UN SDG#14) and in fact, many of the other UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) really won’t matter. Each of the 17 UN SDGs individually is irrefutable, all make perfect sense and each one represents a critical building block in making the world a better place for future generations.  We must pursue the UN SDGs, however, this cannot be at the expense of failing the most urgent, overarching climate challenge before us.  Some have suggested that the global pandemic has provided respite for the environment as evidenced by improved air quality and reduced greenhouse gas emissions - and it has. But that is something of a ‘false-positive’ as most of the improvements noted have already been nullified as the world returns to pre-pandemic activity. The climate challenge is unique as there is no historical data to predict how it will play out, how bad it may get, and it is unlikely to follow any linear projections. We know and we are already seeing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events increasing significantly. Scientists have provided us with very compelling data that strongly recommends we limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels (the Paris Agreement). To achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, we need to bring global GHG emissions back down to 1980 levels by 2030, and thereafter to net zero around 2050.  We will reach net zero when the amount of GHGs we produce is equal to the amount we remove from the atmosphere,...... and we will reach 2030 in just over eight years from now! To say that time is of the essence would be a massive understatement. If we fail to meet the 2030 target reductions, then the challenge becomes exponentially more difficult and the probability of failure increases significantly.  Climate-indicators have never been clearer.  All the lights are flashing red! This is singularly the largest, most complex challenge humanity has faced and one that will require marshalling all critical resources in a tightly coordinated, never before undertaken, global scale. We can learn from history and look at examples of successful countries, companies, and individuals. In most cases, their success has come from maintaining a maniacal focus on a few key priorities, and in many cases, just one single priority. Climate needs to sit at the top of the ESG pyramid - with the UN SDGs acting in support. But as we know, pyramids have baffled scientists for thousands of years...#climatechange #climate #climateemergency #environment #sustainability #climaterisk #esgrisk",0

"Happy Friday! Well at least for now it is not the Financial Stability Oversight Council that is conducting the meeting. The FSOC could designate stablecoins as systemically important and subject them to Fed. (capital intensive/bank-like) regulation. However, some stablecoins operate like money market funds and could be regulated by the SEC....but the SEC (with pressure from the Fed/Treasury) is planning to further tighten up on money market fund regulation in the near future.#cryptocurrency #risk #stablecoins #cryptocurrencies #cryptowallet #cryptotrading #moneymarketfunds #sec #banking #fintech Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will convene a meeting with banking and markets regulators on Monday to review the growth of so-called stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency whose value is tied to an underlying asset like the U.S. dollar.The meeting will include the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets as well as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The presidential working group includes the chairs of the Federal Reserve, the SEC and the CFTC.Treasury said the group will look at ""the current regulation of stablecoins, identify risks and develop recommendations for addressing those risks."" The meeting is a follow-up to a December report that the President's Working Group issued on stablecoins.“Bringing together regulators will enable us to assess the potential benefits of stablecoins while mitigating risks they could pose to users, markets or the financial system,” Yellen said. “In light of the rapid growth in digital assets, it is important for the agencies to collaborate on the regulation of this sector and the development of any recommendations for new authorities.”",0
"“An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.”—Benjamin FranklinLast week, I graduated with Honours from Leiden University College The Hague and thereby concluded my BSc. degree with a specialization in the areas of Governance, Economics, and Development. Reaching this point in my academic career has been both a rewarding and an inspiring experience which I trust will enable me to magnify my positive impact within, and beyond, my circles. One of the ways in which I sought to create a positive impact in the past year was through my research into the effect of COVID-19 on the subjective financial stress levels of students and young professionals in The Netherlands for my bachelor’s thesis. My findings, although inconclusive, suggest that particularly first-generation students seem to have been at risk of experiencing elevated levels of subjective financial stress as a result of the pandemic. In response to this, my recommendation to institutions of higher education in The Netherlands, and Leiden University’s Faculty of Governance and Global Affairs in particular, was to provide scholarships with an element of financial coaching to the affected students.However, this achievement does not yet mark the end of my journey in academia. I am excited to announce that, following Benjamin Franklin’s wisdom, I will continue to broaden my expertise by pursuing a MSc. in Business Administration at the Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University in September. Moreover, with RSM’s focus being on the development of business leaders that can become a force for positive change, I believe to have found the right fit and I am looking forward to the commencement of the program.",0

"You need to figure out how you are going to fund your mini-retirement. It’s common to save money to cover your expenses for the period of time you expect to travel. Another option is to develop passive income that can cover your expenses while you travel.Look at your recent credit card statements to see what recurring or subscription payments you can cancel while you are traveling. Make sure you have online payment options for everything else. I’d highly recommend automating your finances as this makes everything a lot easier. Check out Episode 35 for a full guide to automating your finances.You can leverage what you already own to create passive income to fund your mini-retirement. Since you’re only taking a short break from work, you might not want to sell everything you own to travel the world forever and you might still want to hang on to your house and your car.To make money on these while you’re away, you could rent your car to other travelers on Turo and rent out your house or sublet your apartment to a long-term renter, or to short-term renters on AirBnB.If you’re curious about how to afford a mini retirement, listen to Episode 43 ?? https://lnkd.in/dTN7mPs",0

"Even if you are a beginner, I would highly recommend you to start blogging ASAP. Don't think about SEO, Ranking, even sounding smart. Just start because until you write 10-20 blogs, you won't become better.Here is how to get started ?? ??? Selecting Platform :1. WordPress (Difficult) - Need to build a website from scratch and research plugins2. Custom Website (Difficult) - Need to build the website from scratch3. Medium ( Easy ) - Famous for writing all types of blogs. Just need to sign up4. Dev.to ( Easy )- Famous to get started with tech blogs5. Hashnode.com ( Easy ) - Famous to get started with tech, programming blogs??? What to write: This is where most people get stuck, I do agree that everything that we know is already available over the internet, but that is not stopping others from writing, and it should not stop you as well. The easiest way to find a topic about blogging is via daily routine, write about your recent bug fix, what was your problem, how you solved it, what methods you tried, etc.Try to focus on one task at a time? Plan content : Don't worry about SEO for the time being. because good content always finds its way up. Take pen and paper and write down bullet points that'll act as header. e.g. - What is Javascript, Why to use ES6, etc. Once done, then fill content in bullet points. At this point don't think about sounding smart, grammatical things. Focus more on backing your blog with research facts, figures.?? Publishing : Once the first draft is written, go away from it at least for 6 hours, and then take a look at it again, you'll automatically see things that are not important, or things that are missing, grammar that can be corrected, etc. Sharpen the blog accordingly and publish it???? Comment down the recent blog you wrote, ???? Share with your developer friends #programming #content #blog",0

"Here another management annoyance I have seen so often; hiring an ex-colleague by the boss.Six times in my career I changed company, with the last five in senior management roles. I _never_ hired someone from a previous company into my new team.While it may appear to be a safe bet to hire an ex-colleague and it may give you a short-term win; it is risky business, so be careful!1) Successes from the past are no guarantee for the future.The rehire may have done well in your previous company, but success is depending on so many elements and bringing in that person into your new company with new values and a different culture will expose him to new challenges and it is by no means said he/she will shine again. 2) The new hire is in an odd positionThe whole team knows he/she is a buddy of the boss and the team will be confused how to deal with him/her. The person usually has a direct communications channel with the boss and the team will naturally avoid him in discussions about the boss, afraid this will get leaked. Poor guy, or girl....3) The boss is not objective to the personAs this is a 'boss-hire' you will see the boss cannot look at the person with independent eyes and may miss issues the new hire causes in the team. The boss will be inclined to protect his 'man'.4) The invasion of the job snatchers!Hiring a single individual from the past may have is risk, hiring several from the previous company may completely destabilize the team. The boss is now bringing in his own army, the rest realize they are being side tracked and will get demotivated.Before you know you will see valuable old-time team members leave.So what???Your safest bet is to just _not_ do it. Only exception would be when in a start up where you have to build a team or complete new team from scratch.Companies should have a no-hire policy for Senior Managers to hire from their previous company. It is a recipe for disaster!Companies often have rules man and wife can't work in the same team, why not also apply that in this context?Note, peers recommending ex-colleagues into suitable roles is if course ok. Especially if the hiring team has no previous work experience with the person and is unbiased.Finally, if the company does allow this poor practice, and the boss is considering hiring an ex colleague into a senior rule in his team, he/she should completely disconnect him/herself from the process and leave the interviews and assessments to others. With the boss in the room you create a biased process where it will be very hard to have an open independent discussion. My advise, if you struggle for talent it's best to put all focus on your existing team and support them in their development. Trust me, your focus and your commitment to them will result in a huge payback in company loyalty. Don't fall into the re-hire trap!Thoughts?#companyculture #managementstyle #donotrehire",0

"?What’s the bravest thing you’ve ever said?? As a recently published author , I’m often asked what my favourite business book is. In fact, right now it is ‘The boy, the fox, the mole and the horse’ by Charlie Mackesy.  As you will know if you’ve read it, it’s beautifully written and accompanied by wonderful hand-drawn illustrations and centred around a journey of friendship, love, resilience, vulnerability and compassion.  It is not technically a business book, of course, but resonates far more than many I have read. ?I recommend it as one of the best human-centred leadership books for dipping into, to find inspiration and get to the heart of what really matters. ?Especially now and especially as leaders everywhere are being challenged to demonstrate more heart, more empathy, more EQ , more vulnerability, more compassion, more courage etc. In fact, the very same as their people, as we emerge from a global pandemic, years of transformation and into a more unpredictable future. We are stronger together and all facing an uncertain decade ahead. Leaders, managers, teams, customers, partners, families, friends. These human-centred traits are the power skills for now and this book illustrates the point beautifully, deeply and with a lasting imprint. One of the quotes I love to use is: ?‘What’s the bravest thing you’ve ever said?’ asked the boy. ‘Help’, said the horse?It is full of snippets like this one, which highlights the opportunity for coaching, self-learning personal development and open discussion at all levels and especially for many leaders today. We all need a little help, a little inspiration and a lot of ?heart? - even at the very top. Maybe you can dip in, take a look and be inspired for the week ahead. Happy Monday! #leadership #inspiration #leaders #people #loveandrespect",0

"What a lovely couple of weeks I’ve had – finally getting out for a few Face to Face meetings in between the inevitable Zoom calls! This is what I love about being self-employed, the chance to meet such a diverse range of interesting and inspiring people.I met with Sharron Wilkinson of Give…A Few Words. Sharron set up this amazing project not long ago, and it has gone from strength to strength. Thanks Sharron, it was lovely to hear how well it is all going.I had an extremely useful Power Hour over Zoom with Rachel Hands who acted as a critical friend and really challenged some of my assumptions – and gave me a bit of a boot up the backside and challenged me to promote my new e-book more. (Ahem, link is below before you start Rachel!) I definitely recommend this new Critical Friend/Power Hour service that Rachel has developed. Then I had a virtual 121 with Michael Goddard and learned about his role at not for profit organisation WPA - Western Provident Association and how they can help organisations with employee wellbeing. Very interesting to find out they have a benevolent fund that state schools can apply for – I’ll be popping that in my next schools funding newsletter! Thanks Michael, great to meet you.It was back to Coffee Boy to meet with Jason Taylor from One Community Foundation Kirklees , and we spent an hour chatting about how local businesses can support community groups and charities. I think we might just have one or two ideas between us!!!And last but not least, I attended my first Sported Volunteers network meeting. Online this time, but was great to meet some of the other regional staff and volunteers, along with Volunteer Coordinator Evan Whetsell, and I’m looking forward to getting more involved with this organisation.And somehow, I managed to fit in 2 gym sessions and 3 bouldering sessions this week – and I finally managed to beat that horrible pink number 9 problem at #Freeklime Chris Whitehead!!!Do I deserve a glass of something cold and fizzy this weekend?Link to my e-book if you want to know more!!https://lnkd.in/d7DSXHF #people #funding #freeklime #community #lifeworkbalance",0
"In the last few months, I have learned and immersed myself in Organizational Design for Digital Transformation.This was done through taking an MIT online course by that name and reading the book ""Designed for Digital"" written by Jeanne W. Ross  (who also runs the online course), Martin Mocker and Cynthia M. Beath. This is very hot recommendation (Blog post in Hebrew in first comment) for all those trying or working in the Digital transformation of big old companies – which is the focus of this content. Three big takeaways from the book (amongst many others):1.      The difference between Digitize and Digital: this articulation is critical as they are both called today a digital transformation, but they are very different and require different elements, processes, discipline and more. Digitizing is an enhancement of current offerings and process with digital technologies – more efficiency, scale and outcomes. Digital is the rapid creation and innovation of new value offerings to your customers leveraging digital technologies. 2.      A framework for change: The Authors lay out a very clear Lego brick framework in order to transform. Five bricks that need align to the organization, its vision and current state:  Operational Backbone, Shared Customer Insights, Digital Platform, Accountability Framework and External Developer Platform. 3.      Big old companies: In healthcare big old companies rule, and this is why this book is so relevant, it doesn’t look at quick and nimble startups but the heavyweight, sometime not so sexy organizations and makes it easy to relate and understand it is possible. For me this book and course rang many bells inside my head and that’s why I am so happy to recommend. #digitaltransformation #innovation #corporateinnovation",0

"Chuffed to be ranked as a top recommended family law barrister in Spear's Magazine - one of only about 30 barristers practising family law in this jurisdiction and with some stellar former colleagues at 1 Hare Court as well as others who I also now instruct for company! It’s so pleasing to be recognised but even more pleasing that my amazing solicitor colleagues in the Forsters LLP family and private client teams are also so highly rated (and I’ve no doubt the rest of the team will all be recognised in the years to come, what an amazing team). If I think back to what life two years ago looked like when I left the independent Bar - depressed, burned out and on the verge of doing something entirely different, to now (helping to manage and grow our lovely & busy team, collaborating and learning every day, in a firm that really values its people, and happily married with a settled and well balanced life) I feel so blessed. When I left the Bar people told me I was “brave” / “are you mad?” etc. Sometimes in life you have to properly shake things up to grow again both as a professional and as a person. It’s so ‘easy’ to continue doing something just because that’s what you have always geared towards even if you are down a blind alley from a well-being perspective. Personally I (mostly anyway!) now love developing long term relationships with, and resolving issues for, clients, and instructing former colleagues at the Bar to do the talking when necessary. It’s a tough gig. I’ve been there and have enormous respect for you. I’ll forever be in the debt of my firm for taking me, Somaya Ouazzani Legal Recruitment Specialist for identifying the match up, and Sandra Davis at Mishcons, the best solicitor I worked with consistently when I was at the Bar (among many brilliant others - you know who you are!) for making me realise my skill set could work in a law firm. But most of all Jo Edwards Rosie Schumm and Simon Blain for being the best and most talented (all also recognised in Spear’s) partners I could ever have wished for. I look up to you all. Thank you.

For me it is indeed a completely new #experience, but on the other way, something I have thought for at least few years. Finally, I have a real possibility to #create new particles, new #formulations, new indications, design new #studies. Especially this is one of the most interesting projects that I have encountered, as part of which we are looking for new formulations of #nutraceuticals (with greater #bioavailability, i.e. the possibility of using a lower dose, or with the current doses, but finally, much more effective), under which we work, among others, on one of the most interesting nutraceuticals - curcumin, looking for new groups of #patients who can benefit most from #supplementation.It is also something that he has been dealing with for last several years - building new standards and #recommendations for the #safety of nutraceutical application as part of the search for the best administration strategies, i.e. the continuation of #nutrivigilance development.Finally, it is a really unique #team of people focused on the effect and success!

"Has someone helped me get to where I am now?I feel very lucky to have developed a network of amazing women leaders in my life over the last decade. From Sarah Lewis to Meera Oak to Madison Killen and Diva Winje, AIA, LEED GA. I think having people to go to for career advice and perspective has been so helpful, particularly when faced with a fork in the road.At Magoosh, I would say that Melanie Oei and Jessica Wan have been my biggest mentors (outside of my own amazing manager Peter Poer as well as our CEO). Hearing their reflections on their career paths, listening to their experiences as a manager, and getting feedback and thoughts on the road ahead has been so helpful during challenging times.Are you looking for #mentorship?If so, I'd recommend looking for a couple specific traits:Sincerity + Vulnerability. -Advice I have found the most helpful at times is a past mistake or lesson learned. It takes vulnerability to share that with another human, so they learn from it. Finding someone willing to make those kinds of shares has been the most helpful.Curiosity + Active listening skills. -Some of the other best support I've received has not been in the form of advice but in the form of really, really good questions.-Asking insightful questions that push someone to think in a different way or take a new lens to the situation (e.g. if your best friend was in this position, what framework would you suggest they use here?) can be far more useful than hearing about some tangetially related circumstance.-While it would have been great at times to have had specific advice from a People Operations specific mentor who was in my field but 5-10 years ahead, that exact skill match is not always going to be available or in your network. Beyond that, having someone— who is not far along, who is your peer, who is in a different dept— but is really great at asking questions can be all the thought partnership you really need.In need of #career advice and don't know where to turn? Use LinkedIn! Send out a cold email! Worst case, you don't get a response and best case, you get some great thought partnership!",0

"Meet Christina Ernst, our Product Design intern! Here’s some interesting quotes from her that will give you juicy inspiration for the day.Here’s her recommendation for someone who is a novice to design. “I personally think that learning about the history of something is always a good start. Especially in design, understanding the principles of, for example, the Bauhaus Movement can have a huge impact on your future work. But then again it depends on what triggers and inspires you personally. One thing I recommend is the Braun 100 exhibition at Bröhan Museum Berlin - there is also a video tour available. It covers the history and development of Brauns iconic devices and it's so well done. I loved it.”In the next 5 years, she wants to become a product designer.“I didn’t expect this when I started at #weeve but I fell in love with product design and I can already say that that is what I want to be doing in the future.”Welcome to the team Christina, we look forward to hearing more about your story!#design #productdesign #designer #weeve #startup https://www.weeve.network",0
"WANTED:  RELIABILITY & COMMUNICATION!!!The relationship between the architect and the design team is crucial for the success of any project or build.   Communication must be top shelf! Just as important as the relationship between the architect and the design team is the relationship with your manufacturer representative. You need them, they need you...or at least that's the way it supposed to work. But does your relationship sometimes seem one sided?  What happened?  I have been in the business for close to 20 years. 12 of those years working as a product rep for one of the largest manufacture in the flooring industry. I was really good at my job. I took pride in my strong relationships, which still remain strong today.I was not alone, however, there were a handful of other great reps considered to be excellent at their craft.  Those select few reps over the next decade became both good competition & respected friends.. Respected, because I noticed they were working just as hard as I was at perfecting their game.  They cared!Time went on, many of those great reps like myself were promoted and new reps were brought on board.Within the last year, I was looking to hire a few reps.  I reached out to some of ""my friends"" in the industry for some recommendations...I was shocked, in fact disappointed at what I was told. When I asked for recommendations...many of these industry giants said; ""Honestly Brandon, I can't really recommend anyone""....not even one, I asked,...""No sorry, not even one""  I thought to myself, how very sad.  Times have changed and the talent pool is not the same as it used to be. The same can be said of many other fields. There are some great flooring contractors, who use the services of great installers...yet those installers are aging, and there doesn't seem to be many replacements, at least not lining up to take their place. It's a problem.Each company has to do a better job finding and developing talent.This is what I love about working for Urban Surfaces. We see our role as crucial to your success.  We are more than just a flooring manufacturer and distributor...We are servant leaders, forging relationships. We care!When it comes to phone calls...we call you back, when you need a  specification on a product(s), we send without delay. When designer's request a sample, we send it in a reasonable time and free of charge. We value relationship. It's a culture of care from the top down.#design #success #team #construction #communication #project #business #designers #community #work #love #culture #talent #architect #customerservice #branding #UrbanSurfaces",0
"BTS: A look into how I practiced ?? & developed an Instagram Reel for my travel brand, Simply Briee.What have I learned about Reels?1. Keep it simpleI've developed Reels that included intricate transitions, multiple hair, makeup and clothes changes. I've also developed Reels that were super simple (like the Reel below). Guess what? The simple Reels that take about 15-minutes to complete have performed better than the Reels I took two hours to develop. 2. Be relatable & informativeI've stressed this many times: People love authenticity on social. The Reels that have performed well for me are also relatable and informative. They share insights (in a simple way) that new travelers may not have been privy to. My recommendation: Create simple content that your followers (& non-followers) will save & share with a friend or family member because it's relatable to them.3. Call to actionPeople like to be told what to do...well sort of. Empower your lurkers (non-followers) to want to follow & engage by using CTAs that make them feel like they are making the choice to follow you.Here's one of my favorite CTAs to use at the end of my Reels: Did you find this helpful?

"Silo busting. The bigger the organization, the more of a threat #silos are to the #design team's #creativity, #productivity and #visibility.Training and support is needed to help the #team develop the capacity to overcome these challenges on both individual and organizational levels. For mine, I typically recommend they start with this great article from #harvardbusinessreview on four practices that enable effective interface #work that serve as good reminders:- Develop and Deploy Cultural Brokers—These are people who promote cross-boundary work in one of two ways: by acting as a bridge (possessing considerable knowledge of both sides and can figure out what each one needs) or as an adhesive (bringing people together, helping to build mutual understanding and lasting relationships).- Encourage People to Ask the Right Questions—Leaders show interest in what others are seeing and thinking and teach others to do the same by asking questions.- Get People to See the World Through Others’ Eyes—Leaders can regularly emphasize the importance of diverse expertise by setting up cross-silo discussions with customers, colleagues and other parts of the company and work at the top of the funnel by hiring for curiosity and empathy.- Broaden People’s Vision—Leaders can create opportunities for people to widen their horizons by bringing people from diverse groups together on initiatives and urging them to explore distant networks to tap into expertise outside the company and even outside the industry.Who’s a leader? Anyone who “takes the lead” and plays a role, regardless of what level they are in the organization. It’s the combined contribution that creates a tide that lifts all boats.

"?? An important new book ?? about the Theory Of Constraints (TOC). Recommended for those involved in professional services, strategy, and information / I.T.: “Exceeding the Goal” by John Ricketts. For those that have, as I have, been following the development of the Theory Of Constraints for decades you will know that John Arthur Ricketts is the author of ""Reaching the Goal"" (2007) and was THE pioneer in the use of TOC in I.T. That first book was based on his long career in IBM as a Technical Strategist among other things. I consider that ""Reaching the Goal"" and now ""Exceeding the Goal"" are mandatory reading for those involved in I.T. and interested in TOC. He looks at the subject with a refreshing new angle on I.T. and TOC (a very important duo in 2021). The mix of ideas and his grounding in his extensive experience are very impactful. His case studies (he calls them ""Adventures"") are wonderful and make you laugh and cry.We all have our preferred authors, it is a matter of personal taste, and in the field of TOC in IT John Ricketts is one of my favourites. The topic of Agile is smothering a lot of other important trains of thought in I.T. Take a break for some fresh thinking. #strategy #information #technology #software #theoryofconstraints #goldratt",0

"There was a lot of interest in my previous posting on Venture Idea Assessment. To facilitate rigorous use of this assessment tool we organize three workshops in different time zones as described below. The workshops are mainly pitch towards PhD students and researchers will be highly informative--and interactive--also for those considering use of the VIA measure in their incubator/accelerator/investment practice.We cap each session at 30 to make interactivity possible. You will need to register using the linked form. Welcome! - - -July 26, July 27 and September 3, 2021 (see times below)By Per Davidsson (QUT) and Denis Grégoire (HEC Montréal) What drives assessments of how promising a venture idea might be? How, why and with what consequences do such assessments vary across team members, helpers, investors, mentors, current and potential employees, and the general public? How, why and with what consequences do these assessments vary over time?  Researching these questions requires a clear concept and valid measure for distinguishing assessment of ideas from assessments of the people who pursue these ideas. To address this challenge, we wrote an article, recently published in the Journal of Business Venturing, where we develop the concept and validate a new instrument for measuring Venture Idea Assessment (VIA) across six empirical studies. To foster new research advances in this area and facilitate sound and rigorous use of this new concept and measure, we invite interested PhD students, scholars, educators, and practitioners to take part in an online Professional Development Workshop (PDW) we will be hosting (on the zoom platform). The 60-minute workshop will include a 15-min presentation of the concept's underpinnings and recommendations for using the VIA instrument, followed by 40 minutes of Q&A interactions between participants and the authors and a 5-min synthesis. To accommodate participants located in most time zones, we will host three workshops: Asia-Pacific-Far East: July 2615:00 (3pm) Australian Eastern Standard Time (UTC +10:00)07:00 (7am) Central European Summer Time (UTC +2:00)Americas: July 2717:00 (5pm) Eastern Daylight Time (UTC -4:00)Africa-Europe-Middle-East: Sept 0313:00 (1pm) Central European Summer Time (UTC +2:00)07:00 (7am) Eastern Daylight Time (UTC -4:00)   To foster meaningful exchanges among participants, we will limit participation to 30 individuals per workshop. We invite interested participants to pre-register their intent to take part HERE (or copy the link below into your favorite browser).https://lnkd.in/gsBs_zc For more information on VIA, please consult the article here (free access until August 7, 2021) We look forward to discussing with you the research opportunities afforded by our VIA concept and measure.Per and Denis #phd #entrepreneurship #research #opportunities #assessment #evaluation #accelerator #incubator #pitchcompetition",0

Exclusions can be: ??Wilful injury, negligence, error or omission by the insured or his family members or servants ??Loss or damage caused by improper management, rough handling or during cleaning or change of water??Partial losses of any nature  ??Loss or damage caused by fluctuations of temperature or due to the physical and chemical status of the water, ph-factor or due to low water levels or asphyxia??Natural mortality??Clandestine sale or mysterious disappearance ??Permanent or partial disablement of any nature??Consequential loss arising in any way ??All types of transit losses ??Death occurring within 15 days from the inception of the policy.Valuation: For deciding on basis indemnity, valuation of the Koi can be done based on nature, type, size etc Currently, PSU insurers have an insurance product for fish cultivation or pisciculture. This covers commercial fish such as shrimp or tilapia. Unlike commercial fish insurance which has high moral hazard risk, Koi insurance will likely have low moral hazard as the breeding is done for more recreational and not commercial reasons. Physical hazards are mitigated by proper breeding practices such as installation of safety net over the pond, to ward off predators like cats, dogs, foxes or birds, maintaining water quality and adherence to recommended feeding regimen. Any Indian insurer is interested in developing a Koi Insurance Product to address my client’s requirement as well as exploring similar opportunities, please get in touch with me or write to me at hari@amicusbrokers.com.",0

"“A World Health Organization expert advisory panel Monday issued two new reports recommending the implementation of global standards aimed at preventing unscrupulous, inequitable and potentially dangerous uses of Crispr and other gene-editing technologies.The reports call for efforts to develop global standards, the establishment of an international registry of gene-editing experiments and a way for whistleblowers to report concerns. Their release comes more than two years after a Chinese researcher triggered international outrage when he revealed that he had used Crispr to produce the first gene-edited babies.The committee, made up of ethicists, policy makers and lawyers, said in the reports that the use of gene editing had evolved dramatically since they set out in December 2018 to develop a governing framework and that recent successes in altering the DNA of people with lethal diseases had opened up ethical challenges.The reports described several scenarios that the proposed strategies might help prevent, including conducting gene-editing trials in low-income countries to develop therapies that would ultimately be too costly for all but the wealthiest ones to buy; unscrupulous clinics offering unsafe or ineffective gene-editing services to people desperate to overcome potentially life-threatening conditions; and the use of gene editing for enhancing traits such as athletic ability.“We want people to look at what is happening now and what we need to do to shape the way the research will proceed,” said committee member Françoise Baylis, a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, and an expert on the ethics of human gene editing.”",0

"Allergens can be a scary subject, but it doesn’t need to be!

Wheat is one of the top 8 allergens. It should be introduced at the start of solids, at six months or later. ??????????????????I love to have parents introduce wheat by using toast.

"The Green Tariff policy announcement by the Hon. Minister of Power Shri R K Singh will be a paradigm shift for the renewable energy sector in India. WWF India along with it’s members, as part of our REDE (Renewable Energy Demand Enhancement) programme would like to express our gratitude to MoP and MNRE for their consistent openness to innovative ideas and for inviting us for discussions and recommendations on green tariffs and other alternative procurement options. This was part of an active constructive discussion on policy asks (issues and solutions) to increase uptake of renewables among C&I consumers to MNRE & MOP in 2019, 2020 and 2021. This included MNRE & WWF hosting the first Green tariff discussion in 2020 with REDE  members and discoms. The following excerpt from the Minister's interview is a game changer: ‘Green tariff will be slightly lower than the tariff from conventional fuel sources and added that the new regulations will help ensure that if an industry wants only green power from a developer, the open access applications will have to be approved within a fortnight.’ We’re also grateful to our REDE members, other supporting C&I consumers and our partners for the unflinching support throughout the journey. Our journey supporting and pushing alternative RE procurement models particularly Green Tariffs since the launch of our report “Global Corporate Renewable Procurement Models: Lessons for India” in Dec 2019 can be seen in the video below: We look forward to the finer details of the policy and hope that it will balance the interests of all stakeholders including DISCOMs and provide a necessary boost to the entire renewable power segment in India.  ACC, Ambuja Cement, Avery Dennision, Dalmia Cement, Diageo, Infosys, ITC , JK Tyres, Marico, Pratibha Syntex, Siemens, Yes Bank, Galaxy Surfactants, Mahindra, Godrej Industries Ltd, Godrej Properties Limted, Godrej Consumer Products Limited, Godrej Agrovet Ltd, Godrej & Boyce, Amazon, IKEA, Decathlon, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Saint Gobain, Grasim, P&G, AAK Kamani, AB InBev and other people who contributed.

"5 Tips to Attracting New Online Customers1. Improve Your Site's Search Engine Optimization (SEO)Search engine optimization is what helps your site show up in search engine results when people look for what you're selling. Optimization involves making sure your site's content includes the keywords and phrases people type into search engines.When you've got a keyword list, rewrite the related page's content to include the keyword at least three to four times.""Sometimes the best way to find the most appropriate keywords for your website is to use a competitive analysis tool to study the websites of your competitors, ""Try to figure out which keywords they are targeting so that you can target similar ones and find your way past those competitors.""~2. Create Content Around ""Long-Tail"" Keywords""Long-Tail"" keywords are terms with lower search volumes because they're very specific—the searcher often knows exactly what they're looking for.There will be lots of searches for a phrase like ""pet supplies,"" but the term is so broad that you don't even know if it applies to dogs, cats, or guinea pigs. Instead, look for long-tail keywords that reveal the intent behind them.""A phrase like 'buy 6-foot dog leash' is much more specific and the intent behind it is much clearer. While long-tail keywords will not drive as much search volume, they will drive more qualified traffic to your online store.After developing your long-tail keyword list, he recommends creating detailed landing pages for the products that fit those keywords, making certain that the text includes the appropriate phrases. Site visitors arriving on that page can then immediately add the corresponding product to their shopping cart.~3. Blog About Niche TopicsBlogging is one of the easiest and most effective ways to attract site traffic. When you write articles that incorporate your ideal customers' search terms, your site will show up higher in search results.By using the SEO research tool Ahrefs to identify keywords, and then writing helpful how-to or otherwise informative articles about the keyword topics.  You can increase your traffic by 1,000%.""For example, if you search on Google for 'blonde roast coffee' or 'blonde roast,' you'll see that the number one article right now points to your website, not Starbucks,"". ~4. Use Social Media StrategicallyRather than spreading yourself too thin across multiple social networks, focus on one or two that your target audience uses the most. Develop a mix of content that is useful, informative, promotional, and fun or entertaining, as long as it's in line with your brand personality. You can also use video to demonstrate or images to inspire.~5. Get Smart About Email MarketingBuild an email list by offering something of value that encourages people to add themselves to your list. Retailers often do that with a new-customer discount on the first order. Then stay in touch regularly with updates, information, and offers.",0

"I will be shortly be hitting 10 years at LV.... which is a nice round figure to be leaving on! I've experinced a whole range of life events during my time there, formed great connections, many of whom are on my favourite people list and ones that I am still very much in contact with on a regular basis. The strength of LV has always been about the people that work there.The hidden job market really interests me so if you know anyone that would be open to having a chat about roles (or want to talk through about what they might need), please let me know!I have been spending a bit of time familiarising myself with the traditional job search process to explore what is out there. I'm really finding it interesting observing how the recruitment process works (and feels) from an end to end candidate perspective.  So far my best of breed process would look like this....1. Best job search - Otta.com - great layout, thoughtful and well written roles, doing things differently.2. A recruiter understanding the job requirement and creating an easy to read and encouraging job advert -  Mark Doherty at LV= GI.3. Transparency with contact details for the hiring manager. That goes to Bournemouth University - Donna Hornsby emailed me back within the hour with a very helpful response! 4. Most efficient and timely - Monzo Bank.5. Best pro-active feedback - Nationwide.6. Most improved - JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Strong emphasis on flexible working and removal of technical jargon!7. Best overall end-to-end experience - Nationwide Building Society Clear direction of travel from CEO, easy to use job search & application process, clear communication, insightful videos, transparent interview process and proactive feedback. Really engaging experience when connecting with employees like Richard James & Jon Hull who don't need to reply but show their passion for where they work.My summary so far? Things have moved on with job descriptions and less 'must have's' however the search and process is still quite focused on job titles - the work that Rob Baker, FCIPD, MAPP is doing fascinates me as I believe the future of work will be 'what canvas of skills' can someone bring. If anyone is interested in exploring this, get in touch!I have gained a really good understanding of the outplacement process - Eleanor Tweddell and Amanda Paradine are experts in their fields (check out Another Door) and Lee Hecht Harrison really offer a comprehensive offering with passionate and knowledgeable staff like Sally Ann Robertson.

"Dear C-suite folk of companies of all sizes...I started using Excel over 20 years ago and for almost a decade of that time period Excel didn't change.  We had time to learn from our colleagues by looking over their shoulder.  This was OK.These days significant new functionality is appearing every 6 months and dramatic feature enhancements capabilities are appearing every couple of years.If you are happy to continue with inefficient daily work practices then stick with assumption that your staff ""know"" Excel. In my experience they probably learned Excel 5-10 years ago, or have learned from someone that learned it 15-20 years ago.   Their knowledge is likely out of date.  If you'd like the organization to be more efficient then staff should receive Excel Training every 3 years as a minimum.  This is a product they use all day every day, so every little improvement has a big impact.  My recommendation is to make sure that a ""skills update"" training course covers Tables, Power Query, Dynamic Array formulas, Pivot Tables and at least an overview of Power Pivot, otherwise look for another training provider.   Then for those people who have the ""data gene"" give them dedicated Power Query , Power Pivot and even Power BI training.  They'll love it and your organization will benefit from having these internal data champions in the team.I'm an Excel and Power BI Trainer so I've clearly got skin in the game here,  but that doesn't make me wrong.WynMicrosoft MVPExcel and Power BI Developer and TrainerOnce upon a time Chartered AccountantAccess Analytic Training:https://lnkd.in/gkqWWrW",0

"When you USE YOUR HANDS A LOT, you become great friends with people like Hand Therapist Deborah Austin.  I have developed ""Trigger Thumb"" in both of my hands.  I am so talented, I have a ""double"" trigger in my right thumb!!! Very painful and stiff.   I was on the verge of doing surgery, which is a fine choice, but someone said you might want to consider hand therapy first.  So I did. She taught me several exercises to where I could bend the tips of my thumbs and prevent the other fingers from developing this condition. Very hard to pick up things without that flexibility.  Still a work in progress to get the swelling down, but grateful for the work she's done along with her partner Ivette, who helps her from time to time.  I must say she is pretty booked up, but it's an option you might want to consider.  Appreciate the recommendation by #MichaelGoldstein, always looking out.",0
"Pay it Forward Friday.... If you don't know Mr. Wonderful aka ""Sammy Steinmark"", then where have you been? I have worked with Sammy on various PVF (Pipe, Valve & Fitting) deals for about 11 years now and he's one of my absolute favorite people in life (first) and in the Oil & Gas industry (second). We always have each other's backs and stay in touch and that's what makes a great business relationship. Sammy played for the NFL and later became a coach, who helped shape the lives of so many accomplished and grateful men. If you have a moment check out this video on YouTube about Coach Sammy Steinmark: https://lnkd.in/gpXqkgT  He's lost most of his southern accent since this video, but he hasn't lost that incredible attitude. Sammy's older brother Freddie Steinmark played for Texas Longhorns Football in the 1960's and developed a bone tumor that took his leg and then his young life. His fight and openness surrounding his battle helped reframe the national conversations about cancer and the fight for a cure. The Longhorn's Scoreboard was named after Freddie & his photo with the words ""Heart"" flash across the Jumbotron before every home game. Sammy strives to pay homage to his brother's memory by presenting himself in the same honorable way as his brother.  If you're looking for a new and solid way to buy PVF, I recommend getting in touch with Sammy at sammy.steinmark@goexpedi.com or Elizabeth Stephens at GoExpedi - she's also an excellent human.

"""Reading The Enemy's Mail: Origins And Development Of U.S. Army Tactical Radio Intelligence In World War II European Theater of Operations.""This traces the development of American radio intelligence at the operation and tactical levels from its beginnings in World War I through the end of World War II. It shows that signals intelligence is useful to the tactical and operational level commander. The study recommends the Army rethink signal intelligence support to the various echelons, primarily through changes to tables of organization and equipment. The thesis covers the initial appearance of radio intelligence units on the battlefields of France in the first world war, identifying specific instances where radio intelligence played a role in a command decision. It also looks at training and doctrine in the period between the two world wars. The thesis also covers the organization, doctrine, and training of radio intelligence units as they prepared for combat. It provides a glimpse into the intelligence support provided to the corps, army, and army group commanders during World War II through examination of actual intercept operations. Where possible, the study compares and contrasts German radio intelligence units and operations with their American counterparts.166p 1992U.S. Army Command and General Staff Collegehttps://lnkd.in/gPqjmmtPicture: Wireless in WW1: Marconi Motorcycle Set",0

"One of the top questions I get from newbie freelancers: ""How do I set my rates?""Unfortunately, there is no one-answer-fits-all for this question.Why?Because your rates are directly linked to your self-worth.When you're freelancing, you don't have a boss telling you ""Here is your set monthly salary"" i.e. this is how much you're worth.Instead, you're in complete control of how much you earn each month. Your salary isn't stagnant. It can go up or down. The ball is in your court to decide how much you're worth.That's scary AF.Sure, you can use ballpark figures from the South African Freelancers Association to figure out your rates or those nifty hourly-wage calculators.But if you don't believe your time and work is worthy of that amount (whether it's below, above, or in line with industry averages) you're going to have a hard time convincing anyone to pay you.And when you couple this with stats like:60% of women say they've never negotiated their salary (study linked below) Most of us are not prepared when we have to start telling potential CLIENTS what we want to be paid.Going into business is a major personal development exercise. All the beliefs that you have will come out of the woodwork to either help you or sabotage your efforts.Want to start working on your money story and beliefs? I highly recommend picking up a copy of You're a Bad Ass at Making Money by Jen Sincero. It's a great place to start and will shed light on what you're holding onto that's affecting how you show up around money.If you're looking for more support to get your freelance writing biz up and running, I'm hosting a 3-day workshop called Write to Wander with Alice Draper.

"Common business sense dictates that no two organizations will be the same in terms of organizational structure, culture, current capabilities etc. so any strategic initiative that may work for one might not work for the other. Yet, when we embark on strategic digital transformation initiatives, even before we look inside our processes and systems, we start asking what others are doing. While some generic best in class approaches can surely be adopted across companies and across industries, following the path of “one size fits all” for strategic initiatives, like developing an strategy around where and how to leverage AI capabilities in your business, is never a recommended path. In my perspective, every organization has a unique DNA.

"I just finished the Service Representative training from Service Strategies and it was fantastic! It covers topics ranging from connecting with professionalism and effective communication, to how to manage customers, calls, and stress. It was an incredibly insightful training and I could not recommend it enough.I even learned something about myself! During the section on ""Energy Profiles"", I discovered that my input preferences lean towards ""Grounded"" with touches of ""Creative"" while my process preferences are a combination of ""Logic"" and ""Relationship"" energies. Now I just need to focus on developing the areas where I identify with less!If you are looking to level up your support skills and maybe learn something about yourself, you should give this training a shot. It was worth every penny.#training #communication #energy #support #customerservice #career #motivation",0

"To me, Grace Beverley is someone I look up too. Named in the Forbes 30 under 30 list in 2020, and the founder and CEO of two successful businesses, Grace’s story really inspires me. For me, what started as a casual follow on instagram for fitness tips soon developed into a full-blown investment into Grace’s brand and business - spending more money than I would like to admit on gym leggings and equipment!So, when she announced the launch of her podcast, I jumped at the chance to hear her talking about the reality of starting your own business and the challenges you don’t necessarily think of or consider in the beginning stages.I would recommend this podcast to anyone wanting to listen to another side of business - mental health, personal difficulties and the work/life balance.",0

"Great McKinsey & Company interview this week with former Overstock.com executive Seth Moore. Seth's practical experience with dynamic pricing and vision on best practices matches well what we have learned in our over 8 years of experience in implementing dynamic pricing at leading enterprise retailers and brands at Omnia Retail. Some examples:'Dynamic pricing can add value because it allows you to price the entire catalog with the same deliberate attention you give to important SKUs.''The answer to “How often should we change our prices?” is “as often as you have enough data to make a better decision than you did the last time you made a price change.'""Merchants develop their knowledge over time; retailers need to take that knowledge, test it, implement it, and automate it, which will free up merchants to focus on improving assortments and other merchandising levers.""""Bringing merchants into the process early—so they can contribute to the development of algorithms and strategies—is critical. Involve them in the strategy formulation. Tell them, “We’re building an algorithm that will make pricing decisions in your category, using the same logic that you would use.”""""By far the most important thing you can do, even if you don’t change anything about your pricing logic, is to fix your cost data. If you don’t know your item-level costs, you can’t make good item-level decisions.""""Another lesson is that you should carefully consider consumer perception. Your price changes should never make the consumer wonder, “Am I being gouged?” Figure out what makes sense for your organization and for each product category. Is there a long buying cycle? Do shoppers tend to look at online customer reviews before they buy? Some categories—mattresses, for example—are heavily considered and researched, and there’s no urgency in the purchase process; customers will come back and view the same item a dozen times. But that’s not true of many other categories. So study web-analytics data to inform your dynamic-pricing approach.""[regarding personalized pricing] ""I recommend keeping base prices consistent so that consumers don’t feel discriminated against: “Why is that person getting a better price than me?” You should factor in promotions and shipping costs when setting your base prices. But you can offer some level of personalized pricing through discounts.""--> If you want to receive a pdf of the full article, let me know via the comments or PM. #retail #dynamicpricing #omnichannel #ecommerce #pricing",0

"The importance of having professional goals beyond work is hugely valuable, and something I completely underestimated until this year.I’d seen an Event Grads post on Facebook for industry newbies to enter the V Disrupt competition, to design some ideas for the micebook V Awards and compete for the chance to make the ideas come to life. I commented on the post to see if anyone wanted to team up, and the wonderful Ayame Kaikawa commented. We began video calling once a week, for 3 weeks, to develop our plans and create something to put forward to the judges.We submitted our proposal and later found out we’d made the final of the competition, meaning we now had to pitch our ideas verbally to the judges. It was an incredible experience, and although we did not win the competition, it was a huge learning experience, and I am so proud of putting myself out there. In the past year, I have grown so grateful for the network I have built, and look forward to finding and creating more opportunities to continue my professional development.If you want to mix things up and try something new before the end of the year, I recommend expanding your network and working on a project with someone new. It doesn’t need to be huge, but it’s so fulfilling ?",0

"I've been working as a software engineer for almost five years but unfortunately never, ever had the experience of designing the deployment process and neither deployed anything into the production environment. That’s why my inner self really wanted to release something no matter whatever the app does and in the end, I did it! You know, better late than never!So, what does the Firecracker Vocab Practice do? Well, just imagine yourself as a lexicographer (or a group of lexicographers) enlisting unknown vocabulary into a personalized dictionary. Although, I believe other apps available on the Google Play Store are similar to this, TBH, I didn't consider delivering a unique app. An app is not just about writing bunches of codes. Therefore, I asked my near and dear ones and they helped a lot regardless of their busyness. Someone helped me choose the framework. Some other helped me to improve the UI and it is better than what I designed. If you look into the screen-shots on the Play Store, you may notice four test users with beautiful names and avatars. Not any of them had come from my brain. Even the name of the app and the logo are recommended and designed by my friends. There was a lot of vocabulary written in the Google Docs file. Unfortunately, I could not make it an automated process to insert those into the database because we didn’t follow any standards while adding those. So one of my friends transformed it into a TypeScript file. Definitely, that was a tedious and monotonous task but it has been done smoothly. I would like to thank my alpha test users, without them, I wouldn't be able to fix the last-minute bugs. As a developer, I know it is really difficult to release a bug-free app. So, my humble request is to report any kind of bug. Also, feel free to suggest anything. And it would be nice if you have a look at two of my repositories.BTW, it is not only an Android app, there is a web app too! But it is not functioning as the front-end makes the request to an HTTP server and is eventually blocked. Right now, I'm not thinking about a custom domain and SSL certificate. Therefore, only the sign-in page is being loaded. But you know, it is really an amazing thing that my own codes can run on various platforms!Priyanka Tarafdar Bristi, Nabila Tabassum Chowdhury, Parvez Mahbub, Nosheen Tasnim Chowdhury, Anirban Dutta, Anastasiia Shyrokovska, Felipe Calderano, Mannu Bardhan Paul, Khyrul Bashar; my heartfelt thanks to you!

"I am not always an advocate of the most current #tech.  #Reactjs is currently powering nearly nine million websites worldwide.  WIth an estimated 200 million active websites, that means reactjs is running nearly 5% of the active internet at the time of this post (Y'all can fillet me if my math or stats are wrong).  Many of the projects we work on as a #freelancedeveloper do not require heavy libraries like reactjs.  Also, many of them use aging but mature technology stacks (hello php developers).  This being said, I have to admit I have been absolutely loving developing websites with #gatsbyjs and #graphql.  I feel that it is a front end framework that I will stick with for a while because it is both fast and has an awesome plugin ecosystem baked in.  I am really appreciating the modularity of react and the ability to create rich, dynamic ""static"" websites using the graphql queries.  if you are a #webdeveloper, I highly recommend giving gatsbyjs a try for smaller projects.  Heck, it can even do more complex projects like e-commerce if you want.  I am looking forward to sharing this website and its awesome performance gains soon,  #fullstackwebdeveloper #jamstack #javascriptdeveloper #scss #reactdeveloper #reactjsdevelopment #webdevelopers #nodejsdeveloper",0

"POST-PANDEMIC TALENT ACQUISITION — HIRING ON A VIRTUAL THREAD Here we are almost halfway through 2021 and is it possible the “end” of the pandemic may be in sight? At least in the US and other Covid-19 vaccinated nations, there is daylight ahead and we are reopening. Does that mean we will be going back to traditional methods of talent acquisition and management? How will the hiring process look in the years ahead? We have learned that new virtual tools and processes are required for both recruiters and candidates in the remote and hybrid work environments in the future.Many HR professionals would likely enjoy going back to work onsite with in-person contact. However, that is not likely to be the case due to new methods of remote evaluation, verification, hiring and onboarding remote candidates. HR pros have learned that the pandemic forced a digital transformation in the way technology will be used to make hiring decisions going forward. In an article from Forbes early this year (4 Ways Hiring and Recruitment Will Change In 2021) a Sage report stated, “24% of businesses have started using AI for their talent acquisition needs, with 56% of managers planning to adopt automated technology in the next twelve months.” And, from a survey by the Society for Human Resource Management, it is estimated that “18% of companies use psychometric testing in the hiring process. This is expected to increase by 10-15% per year.” So, clearly, this is the direction this process is moving.NEW TOOLS AND SKILLS FOR THE MODERN HR MANAGER TO STAY CURRENT AND RELEVANTDigital hiring tools like pre-hire assessments and virtual interviews will be utilized for improved job matches. This leads to more efficiency and saves repetitious, routine tasks — allowing the HR pro to focus on high touch, subjective contact with candidates. And with virtual interviews, using video technology creates more fairness and consistency when interviewers use the same video and questions. According to TTISI — a leading assessment developer — it is recommended that assessment results comprise up to 40% of the hiring decision, with other evaluation methods to complete the final decision.HOW DO PRE-HIRE ASSESSMENTS HELP INCREASE CULTURES THAT SUPPORT DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION?Objective tools like psychometric assessments measure human characteristics based on social science and other research. Common areas for understanding job candidates include behavioral work styles, motivators, skills and competencies, emotional intelligence, and other critical factors. The process is “blind” and shows key areas like strengths, ideal work environments, and best match for team positions based on skill sets and compatibility, not personal preference and appearance.In the next article, let’s get specific with different types of assessments used for hiring line-staff to executives. We’ll also take a look at how these science-based tools can be used for onboarding and ongoing career development.",0

The course is an immersive and interactive experience which taught me so much about leadership – upwards, sideways, in a team and in yourself. It was inspiring and engaging and has left me feeling excited about applying my learnings in the real world.I’d highly recommend the course to anyone in marketing who is looking to enhance their leadership skills whilst developing their professional network. Before I go, I’d like to share my three key takeaways from the course with you:1. Make sure you’re working in the Value Creation Zone - the point at which your company and customer needs meet and overlap. If you’ve not already defined the V-zone, it’s time to do it. 2. Take the quality staircase. Work with others (colleagues, teams and agencies) who push you to deliver the best.  3. Be brave. Bravery = purpose – fear. When the time is right, dare to put yourself out there. Thanks to Thomas, Syl and Oliver Bowie ACIM ACMI for such a great experience! #leadership #marketing #team",0

"WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF ULTRAFAST GROCERY DELIVERY COMPANIES?First off, I want to compliment Sacra, for the excellent report that I’ve attached. LinkedIn members who read my posts know that I have stated multiple times that the grocery industry will undergo more changes between 2020 and 2030, than has taken place in the prior 100 years. Four things are significantly going to disrupt the grocery industry:1. Micro-fulfillment Centers like those offered by Berkshire Grey, AutoStore, Attabotics Inc., Urbx, Alert Innovation, Addverb, etc. 2. Micro-fulfillment as a Solution. This is the ability of grocery retailers (all retailers, actually) to outsource their micro-fulfillment needs to a third party like Davinci Micro Fulfillment or Uppership (https://www.uppership.com). 3. Mobile retail. Vans stocked with groceries. Instead of hailing an Uber, consumers can “hail a store.”  Robomart is the leader in this category. The other disruptor is the on-demand ultrafast grocery delivery companies that can deliver groceries in as little as 10-15 minutes. Gorillas, JOKR, Dija, Getir, and Delivery Hero, are considered the leaders in the industry. Gopuff and Instacart are attempting to duplicate the ultrafast players but with little success. I want to point out that I have consistently made the argument since 2013, that the main disruptor of the grocery industry will be the desire to increase the speed of deliveries to customers. In addition, deliveries will have to be made to wherever customers are; delivery to people vs. places. Yes, I am a champion for the micro-fulfillment industry but I’ve made it clear that micro-fulfillment isn’t enough. Grocery retailers must embrace automation, mobile retail, and rapid delivery solutions. I agree with the research outlined in the article that it will be a challenge for most of the rapid delivery companies to become profitable. I anticipate consolidation and failures to occur. I also agree with the research that companies like Uber can easily disrupt/replace the local grocery store. This is why I remain critical of the CEOs running grocery retailers who have failed miserably to change their business models by introducing mobile retail, micro-fulfillment or MaaS, and multi-tier services: physical stores, online, and rapid delivery. I laugh at the grocery retail trade shows and conferences that have completely failed to understand how severely grocery retailers will be disrupted by 2030. A review of speakers at the leading conferences are chocked full of such important topics as AI, advertising, and packaging. Ridiculous. The survival of the majority of grocery retailers is at stake and trade shows want to highlight packaging. By 2030, the grocery indistry will look completely different. Most aren’t ready.  #grocery #retail #onlineshopping #ecommerce #microfulfillment #lastmiledelivery https://lnkd.in/eb5TjyK",0

"Yesterday's virtual lunch looked at improving digital ads with 1st party data ??. We also talked about the overall impact of digital marketing in light of continued data privacy restrictions. Thank you to Howard Diamond and Aaron Horowitz from Rise Interactive for co-hosting and sharing a number of insights. Below are a few highlights.?? Great discussion around the CDPs and starting with the use case to figure what you need. If the use case is CRM-driven that may take you in a different direction than if it's media driven. Lightweight CDP solutions are possible such as leaning into your ESP or tag manager.?? Retail media is working and is scalable. It's important to find the right retail partner and your mileage will vary depending on the product you're selling.?? The impact so far from data privacy restrictions that are creating less sophisticated targeting includes lower CPCs and CPMs. As far as metrics, mid-funnel is taking the biggest hit due to changes such as Facebook shortening its attribution window.?? There seems to be a consensus that retargeting outside of the Facebook and Google ecosystems have seen significant decreases in performance.#digitalmarketing #ecommerce #dataprivacy #cdps #roas cc Veronika Sonsev, Allan Dick, Emily Wander",0
"I am excited to share that I joined Valley-Wide Financial Group on July 1st as Chief Operating Officer. Valley-Wide is a rapidly growing, privately held, financial services company based in Western Canada. Their subsidiaries include: Valley Wide Financial Corp., Valley Wide Insurance Services Inc., Prairie-Wide Financial Corp., Prairie-Wide Insurance Services Ltd., and Win/Succession. The Valley-Wide group of companies provide life and general insurance, investment solutions, group benefits and tax planning to individuals and businesses. I look forward to working with Scott Findlay, Darren Bowman, Michael Gau, and the rest of the team.Earlier this year, I joined The Catherine Wheel, a consulting and advisory firm working with and investing in small to midsize businesses in fintech, enterprise Saas and ecommerce as a Strategic Advisor, Insurance. I’ve been able to leverage my experience of building, launching and operating new services, products and business lines. I will continue in an advisory role working with Lina Ismail, Zaheer Merali, Philippe Garneau.My journey started a year ago when I found myself unemployed for the first time. What in some ways was the most challenging year of my life, was in a lot of ways the best year of my life. Before “the summer of Steve” as my partner Katherine Heggie first referred to it, I was fortunate to work at Empire Life for 11 years. I have great respect for Empire Life and the people who work there.I have a ton of energy and without work, I needed to stay busy. Office time was replaced with manual labour including building the best Zamboni on Dog Lake. Patent pending.I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who helped me with my search. I've made 400+ new connections and had 200+ networking meetings. I've been blown away by the support from my partner, family, friends, former colleagues, and new connections.  I am grateful for your encouraging words, advice, introductions, and generosity with your time.  To each and every one of you, thank you.  Special thanks to Candace Thompson, my career transition coach at Right Management. Candace and her team provided me with the guidance and tools I needed to be successful in my search. Thank you Candace!In a Right Management webinar in January, the facilitator ended the session by saying ‘One thing I can tell you for sure, is that you will all find work.’ There were times I didn’t believe it. I am a positive person, yet there were times I feared that I wouldn't find work or I’d have to settle for something I’m not passionate about. To anyone out there looking for work: You will find work. You have a unique set of skills and experience and organizations need your talent. Keep making connections, looking for your dream job, and don’t settle.

"""Demonetisation coincided with the beginning of my career.""We spoke to Prabhav, Business Development Associate at Instamojo about the growth & rise of digital solutions for businesses. ??""I have been involved with digitisation of SMEs & MSMEs ever since I started working. Be it POS machines, online payments, or eCommerce stores, I have had a fair share of experience with India's small business owners. There has been a gradual growth in these businesses opting for digital services. I feel the biggest hurdle for small businesses is that they do not know where to start. There is a gap between the options available to them and the awareness they have. They need a certain sense of handholding to get started; once they start, we have observed a lot of success stories. One of the most crucial aspects of my job is to understand these pain points and help in building solutions. I am glad that I am able to understand and help solve these problems through Instamojo online stores & online payments. If you look at emerging patterns, small towns and cities will actually form the base for our digital revolution. Once the adoption rates go up, they will be the ones driving upward growth. People are slowly learning to incorporate online tools into their business, and the best is yet to come.""#mojofamily #businessdevelopement #bdes",0

"Aluminum picking carts 2.0So our first try at providing custom aluminum carts turned out OK, but the upgraded cart turned out amazing. Super light weight, easy to maneuver / handle, and best of all looks stunning! Working with our preferred local fabricator we went back to the R&D department to discuss useful upgrades. After observing the team using the aluminum carts and paying attention to their habits I realized that a couple properly placed handles would help with further ease of handling the carts. We also added a bit of extra support to the bottom as a safety feature in case someone were to try and use the back bottom shelf as a step (this is not meant to be a step). We adjusted the top shelf height to sit lower to better accommodate the actual team that will be regularly using the carts every shift. And last of all we added a custom powder coat paint in our clients logo color to give the cart a nice clean looking finish. With the growing demand for e-commerce orders to get out quicker than ever to consumers I know these carts are going to be a hit with all of our fulfillment type clients. Light weight and super efficient for picking. Who is next? These carts would look amazing in your company colors, not to mention the efficiency it will help to add to your teams picking!

"As schools break up across the UK and Europe for the summer, brands are already looking to the horizon at the rapidly approaching 2021 Q4 Peak.According to a Retail Week Deep dive: 'Tackling the Fulfilment Nightmare before Christmas', in addition to the usual challenges of retail's peak period, 2021 is facing into a lack of resources in haulage, food processing and production lines, and packing. A warning today from Marks and Spencer CEO Steve Rowe, that store opening hours may need to be reduced due to staff shortages as a result of COVID isolation (the 'pingdemic'), growth in online customer purchasing could continue exponentially.    In 2020, online penetration surged to 31.9% from 20.8% in 2019’s golden quarter, while research from ecommerce specialist ChannelAdvisor has found that over half (55%) of consumers intend to shop online more post-Covid than they did before.  Retailers understandably are working hard to find solutions and partners that will ensure they maximise the significant opportunities in this year's peak period while minimising disruption and disappointment for customers.Focused exclusively on the retail, e-retail and ecommerce sector, here at Ascensos, managing peak period customer interactions for national and international brands comes as standard. Whether it's the Spring peak for DIY and Homeware, the Summer peak for fashion or the Q4 peaks for Black Friday, Christmas and New Year clearance sales, we combine data, technology and platforms with the best people, training and location strategies to support our clients and their customers - whatever their supply chain and logistical challenges may be.#ecommerce #retailing #innovation #economy #onlineshopping #shoppingandtheretailindustry #customerservice #rpa #digital #automation #21stCenturyRetail",0

"For those who aren't yet aware, last year I enrolled in the UT Austin Boot Camp for full stack web development. I'm very excited to announce that I recently completed the program and am now ready to start applying for web developer positions!! ??Please take a look at my portfolio website, which I created from scratch using many of the skills and tools that I learned in the boot camp.?? Portfolio:  https://lnkd.in/et3zfigI've been working in health care as a registered dietitian for nearly five years now. While I have been successful in this career and am very proud of everything I've accomplished so far, I strongly believe my overall skills are much better suited for the tech field.One of the things that initially attracted me to health care was the desire to help others solve their (??nutrition-related) problems. However, it has become increasingly clear to me over the years that I thrive most when I'm helping people solve problems through the use of ??technology. For anyone who knows me well or has worked with me in some capacity, this will likely not come as a surprise. After all, I always seem to return to my love for computer technology when it comes to solving a variety of problems. This has been true throughout my career as a dietitian and throughout much of my life in general! For these reasons, I'm very excited to finally take this major step forward in my professional journey. Pursuing a career change after investing so much into my current career was a difficult decision for me.

"I've been working as a software engineer for almost five years but unfortunately never, ever had the experience of designing the deployment process and neither deployed anything into the production environment. That’s why my inner self really wanted to release something no matter whatever the app does and in the end, I did it! You know, better late than never!So, what does the Firecracker Vocab Practice do? Well, just imagine yourself as a lexicographer (or a group of lexicographers) enlisting unknown vocabulary into a personalized dictionary. Although, I believe other apps available on the Google Play Store are similar to this, TBH, I didn't consider delivering a unique app. An app is not just about writing bunches of codes. Therefore, I asked my near and dear ones and they helped a lot regardless of their busyness. Someone helped me choose the framework. Some other helped me to improve the UI and it is better than what I designed. If you look into the screen-shots on the Play Store, you may notice four test users with beautiful names and avatars. Not any of them had come from my brain. Even the name of the app and the logo are recommended and designed by my friends. There was a lot of vocabulary written in the Google Docs file. Unfortunately, I could not make it an automated process to insert those into the database because we didn’t follow any standards while adding those. So one of my friends transformed it into a TypeScript file. Definitely, that was a tedious and monotonous task but it has been done smoothly. I would like to thank my alpha test users, without them, I wouldn't be able to fix the last-minute bugs. As a developer, I know it is really difficult to release a bug-free app. So, my humble request is to report any kind of bug. Also, feel free to suggest anything. And it would be nice if you have a look at two of my repositories.BTW, it is not only an Android app, there is a web app too! But it is not functioning as the front-end makes the request to an HTTP server and is eventually blocked. Right now, I'm not thinking about a custom domain and SSL certificate. Therefore, only the sign-in page is being loaded. But you know, it is really an amazing thing that my own codes can run on various platforms!Priyanka Tarafdar Bristi, Nabila Tabassum Chowdhury, Parvez Mahbub, Nosheen Tasnim Chowdhury, Anirban Dutta, Anastasiia Shyrokovska, Felipe Calderano, Mannu Bardhan Paul, Khyrul Bashar; my heartfelt thanks to you!

Those guidelines are now published in the attached ""Guidelines on Minimum Standards for Developer Verification of Software"" The document describes eleven recommendations for software verification techniques. These include:- Threat modeling to look for design-level security issues- Automated testing for consistency and to minimize human effort- Static code scanning to look for top bugs- Heuristic tools to look for possible hardcoded secrets- Use of build-in checks and protections- ""Black box"" test cases- Code-based structural test cases- Historical test cases- Fuzzing- Web app scanners, if applicable- Address included code (libraries, packages, services) ""To ensure that software is sufficiently safe and secure, software must be designed, built, delivered, and maintained well. Frequent and thorough verification by developers as early as possible in the software development life cycle (SDLC) is one critical element of software security assurance.""#ciso #infosec #security #cyber #cybersecurity #publicsector #software #sdlc #devsecops #nationalsecurity #technology #softwaredevelopment #incidentresponse",0

"Dane Morrison, VM’s Information Technology Audit Lead, is today’s personality and high achiever for #TeamMemberHighlight. Take a look at how he stays motivated for excellence. “I once heard someone say, “You drive a lot faster if you know you have good brakes.” And I think this perfectly captures the role of internal audit. It is about providing the VM Group with the assurance and confidence that our controls, governance, processes, and systems are effective and are up to the task of facilitating us in meeting our objectives. So, we conduct reviews to verify that things are working as they should and where we identify gaps or weaknesses, we make recommendations on how those gaps can be closed and those areas strengthened. One of the things that excites me the most is witnessing first-hand the transformation that has taken place and that continues to take place at VM. The development and expansion of our online banking apps and platforms and the overall digital transformation journey are something I am really excited about. I am driven for excellence in all I do, and I think my upbringing has had the most influence in that regard. My parents always urged my siblings and I to do everything we did, no matter how insignificant, with excellence. I can remember my mother drilling into me growing up that if I did my household chores sloppily then that kind of approach would ‘spill’ over into other areas. And the older I get, the more I realise how true that is, you can’t just try to create islands of excellence, areas you are willing to work hard at as opposed to other areas. You must try and develop a culture of doing everything to the best of your ability. My encouragement to other Team Members is to always try to surpass yesterday’s successes. Be teachable, be trainable, learn from your mistakes, your successes, and your team members. Everyone has a lesson to teach; there is so much I have learned from observing and receiving feedback from my colleagues.”",0

I learned by doing- creating a coffee app, and used theory to navigate the project. While writing about Design Thinking simultaneously trying to build an infrastructure with Node.js seemed impossible, we got through it. It was fun and I look forward to further developing our product. I learned a new language, what building a product entails, what working on a team with different specialties is like, amongst many other things.TechLabs Copenhagen did a wonderful job.

It’s quiet, app-controlled and helps me stay cool during those hot summer nights. - What would your superpower be?Had you asked me this 30 years ago it would probably have been ‘invisibility’ but now I’m a bit older and more environmentally aware I’d rather be more like Captain Planet!- Describe one of your interests.A long term interest of mine is to see how we develop as a species, how we tackle complex world problems and how we go about taking better care of our planet and its inhabitants. Your must-see TV recommendation: The new Clarkson show about his farm. Absolutely hilarious, but also interesting to see how he always just goes for it - nothing is impossible. Scary to see he actually becomes quite a decent farmer.  - One thing you're looking forward to.Same as many, I reckon, that life gets back to normal. From a business perspective: face-to-face meetings and IFA, CES and other trade shows to meet old and new industry friends.www.thamesdistribution.com",0

"Best places to hire freelance Bubble Developers?The 'No-Code' revolution has taken the tech world by storm. Bubble is one of the top no-code platforms which allow you to create powerful web apps without knowledge of coding. Here's a list of places where you can hire Bubble Freelancers and Developers:?1) Niche Freelancing Websites:In addition to the mainstream freelancing platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, Freelancer.com and Toptal. There are several niche websites, which specifically focus on technology talent, developers and experts in no-code development tools. Some of the top places to hire bubble developers and other no-code experts are Nucode (Nucode.co), Codemap.io (Codemap.io) and Makerpad (experts.makerpad.co). ?2) Bubble Dev Agencies:?A great way to hire top quality talent which are Bubble experts are looking at the Development Agencies listed on the Bubble website . There are over 200 agencies now listed, ranging all the way from solopreneurs and single member agencies to larger dev shops with multiple employees and expertise in various aspects of application design as well as development. Several of these agencies have been developing bubble applications for many years and offer additional resources (Courses, 1-1 Sessions, Newsletters) in addition to development services. Some of the top agencies in this field are Million Labs, MVP.dev, Airdev and Zeroqode amongst many more.?3) Bubble Forum:Another great way to hire freelance bubble experts is by posting on the Bubble forum. There is a specific category within the forum called 'Jobs/Freelance' - where you can post your job requirements and invite proposals and messages from freelancers and agencies across the world. The posts on this category on the forum typically have between 3-5 responses in addition to the direct messages you can expect to get from available freelancers.4) Social Media Platforms:Social media platforms (particularly LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook and Reddit) can also be a very effective way to hire Bubble or no-code developers, particularly if the requirements that you have are unique. E.g. if you are looking for a developer with expertise in a particular sector, or are looking to hire someone on a non-standard payment terms (e.g. offering cash + equity in return for the development work). There are a couple of ways you can go about this:4a) By creating a post and asking your network for recommendations. Make sure to add additional keywords and hashtags to ensure that the post has the maximum visibility possible. 4b) Using Advanced search functionality to search for profiles with the relevant skills and titles and sending them direct messages.",0
"????? ? ???? ????? ? ! (??) ??????? ??????:https://lnkd.in/dxbPSyA#3 #CodeAndCocktailsStart CodingI started coding the project by creating all the parts described in UML within the Client. I thought it would be convenient for me to be able to check it through the browser.Mistake!!! It led to A LOT of headaches later on. Now I know better and highly recommend coding Backend in Server and checking it through the logger (after all, you will do the same in the browser). And using #postman, which is a fantastic app for sending and receiving requests from the server.Very quickly, I encountered my first problem with the way I looked at the project.Lemons and Bottles do not behave the same. 100 ml is less than 3 shots. On the other hand, 100 lemons is a lot, and I'll never have so many at home.So I recalculated my thinking and created four types of elements that inherit from one abstract object ( #oop ). Bottle, Fruits and Vegetables, Boolean variable (available or out of stock. No quantity) and Generic variable.I also created a DbMuck that simulated my DB and would allow me to check the functions supposed to communicate with it.At this point, I turned DbMuck and the Managers into singletons. There's no need to have more than one instance of these in my application.for ! (not) programmers * I started building the thinking part in the area that displays information to users because I thought it would be convenient to see the information. It was a mistake and caused a mess later!* Planning Inventory only on bottles was incorrect.Lemons and Bottles do not behave the same. 100 ml is less than 3 shots. On the other hand, 100 lemons is a lot, and I'll never have so many at home.* I created a data-saving demo to deal with data saving in my app. Though it's not real, it was real enough for my software.#SmartBarProject #myblog #developer #webdevelopment",0

"Finding the right app development team can be a daunting task. There are many app developers on the market, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that you can just pick any among them to work on your project. The right team will need to understand your needs and your business model to build the right product.Primarily, the critical question you will have to ask is whether you want to hire an in-house team or pick freelancers to work on your project.In-house teams can work on a product from inside your company, but this option can get pricey and may not be right for you. Hiring a team from a software house, however, gives you more flexibility to quickly source developers with the right skills.It is worth noting that in-house developers will cost more in the long run. They know how professional their services are, and they will command a hefty price. While no one can blame them, you will also need to find ways to save money — especially if resources are limited. This is why many choose to outsource instead.Generally, you can answer the question of how to find the best mobile app development company by considering your business and your needs. For instance, if you work at an established firm and would like to get things working much quicker, consider hiring a professional outsourced team. Check our list of 10 Best Countries to Outsource Software Development to help you take the first step to find the right company: https://bit.ly/3wF6kQJStartups can also benefit from the flexibility of working with a software house. Keep your costs in check with a team that adapts to your needs. You can expand a team of specialists quickly to fit your project scope.Reviews sites such as Clutch.com are a great place to start your search. You can easily shortlist companies that fit your needs. Of course, it also never hurts to look through your connections and see if there are recommendations.Read more in our blog: https://bit.ly/36EvuED#softwaredevelopment #appdevelopment #appdevelopmentcompany #hiring",0

"I PASSED my final exam for the professional diploma in UX Design ?? 10 months of late nights and weekends… totally worth it, and I highly recommend the course if you are looking to transition into UX. I have always loved wireframing and prototyping, so I chose this course to explore research techniques, fill any gaps and essentially build a design process from the beginning of research until handing-off to developers. Creating a flight app was a really fun project as there are many facets to consider… kept me on my toes. ?? A huge thank you to my girlfriend and family… studying, whilst working during this crazy pandemic has been a real test. A huge thank you to Ken Loh, Richard Baxter, Bhups Patel, James Killington  for giving me their time and experience through video chats and time zone differences with no trouble at all… absolute legends, and also the rest of the wonderful teams at ?. And lastly, the team at the UX Design Institute for supporting the journey Eoghan, Rebecca, Ultan and Colman Walsh for offering this great course and content.Next steps, finish my portfolio and see what the world has to offer. ?? #userexperiencedesign #interactiondesign #userresearch #experiencedesign #ux #uxdesign",0

"It’s so awesome when men advocate for females in tech. Richard Miller in the UK, was one of the first guys that gave a talk at the Theodo / React Native meet-up in London, and one of the leading experts in React Native at the time, having worked previously for Fat Llama. Richard was also instrumental in August 2019 in helping us move our Travltalk tech stack in house, and sort out our in-app purchase, ejection from Expo kit to being a stand alone React Native app, and removing the concerns we had around Branch.io / Expo tracking. I’ll be eternally grateful to him and wish all developers could be like him. I highly recommend him if you are looking for a top dev. https://lnkd.in/eFR4BZcI have to say, what I learned being a full time developer since, and writing code myself, as well as managing all devs ops, deployments and development choices was a steep learning curve, but something I will never ?regret. Also couldn’t be prouder of selecting React Native when it was still in its infancy and sticking with GraphQL / Apollo and Nextjs for SSR, and moving back to AWS from Vercel for our backend. It’s clear in 2021 these languages and frameworks are the stack of the future.",0

"Amazon, Google, and other giant websites have one thing in common - they are easy to interact with and provide a terrific customer experience. UI/UX are major components of your website or application's effectiveness. Let's have a look at the points below to understand how UI/UX is important for your business: 1. Boosts website & app traffic - An efficient UI/UX design is user-friendly, visually appealing, and contains a flow of useful information. Such kind of interface keeps the audience glued to any site or app. Users are more likely to interact with your website when it has a realistic feel to it and is easy to use. Hence, seamless interaction boosts natural traffic to your site and app. 2. Ensures cost savings - Investing in a good UI/UX design alleviates the number of recurring issues in your website or app. Good UI/UX designs reduce the need for frequent updates and save the time and money that you would have, otherwise, spent on repair and development.3. Increases ROI - An attractive design ensures easy navigation and keeps your customers engaged for a longer time. Highly satisfied customers will recommend your website or app to others and this will further boost engagement. More engagements lead to more conversions, thereby increasing your ROI.Have you optimized the user experience for your business yet?

A California-based security firm reports that these apps are advertised as a way of earning money via mining crypto, but in reality they don’t perform any function. Instead, all of these paid apps include costly upgrades and subscription models to allegedly improve the performance of mining.The security firm recommends knowing the developers behind these apps before buying them, installing them only from the official source, and reading user reviews of the app to look for any anomalies.#security #cryptocurrency #cybersecurity",0

"Q&A session??We're glad to share with you so expected post about the career of our Front-End Developer — Ivan????Could you please tell us about your career start and why did you choose the front-end development?? Back in 2014, when I was still a student at Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, I learned CSS/Html and JS. My friend once told me that the company he worked for was looking for a guy to develop websites. I applied for the position and got it. That's how I first got into the IT industry.??Please tell us more about joining ETER Solutions and what interested you the most in the company?? I found the project interesting: I like to create tools to help businesses. When I joined ETER, the project was just starting, so we had no legacy and had an opportunity to decide which technologies to use. I liked the interview too: I found the TL very experienced and interested in the project. I knew that the product would be used right after the release, and we'd get feedback from our users. Now we already have people using our software: managers who use our web app, and drivers who use our mobile app. It's inspiring to see people using a product we've created.Now I work as a FE developer, so I'm responsible for our Web part??. I wouldn't say that my role has changed a lot over time, but seeing our project developing, I now know every detail of it, so I can plan and estimate the next features better. I also help our new colleagues to get on board.??Please describe your main duties on the project at ETER Solutions.? I'm a Front-End developer, but there was a period when I switched to mobile development. And this is what is really cool about ETER: company allows us to grow by trying new different technologies. Right now, I'm interested in React Native, and I have an opportunity to try it out. Now we're working as a cozy small team, but obviously, we'll grow, and each of us will grow in our career paths.??What difficulties did you face combining the positions of both roles: ReactJS and RN developer?? You know what they say about React: ""learn once, write anywhere"". And this is true, you can start mobile development right away knowing React. You will ‘google’ a lot, and it's fine. Mobile development is really interesting, and I suggest everyone try it at least once. Codewise it’s pretty similar to FE development, but in ?? development you'd use different tools, such as RN debugger, Android and IOS emulators, you'd run your application on a real device. I mean, it’s a whole different experience.??What would you recommend for junior specialists, who just started their careers?? I'd suggest to find a mentor to watch him work and ask questions. ?ode review is helpful too: ask your peers to leave as many comments as they can, and start reviewing the code of your colleagues, it'll help you to gain experience faster.At ETER Solutions we believe that team work make a great work, especially with so dedicated employees.#eter #eterteam #reactjs #reactnative",0

Happy to throw a recommendation on for an upcoming book release by Packt publishing written by Mohamed Labouardy. I've been part of a pre-release reviewers group and it's been an enjoyable read. If you're interested in Gin (gin-gonic) web services and/or Go in general this release is worth a look. The book format is project-based and goes from bare bones up. Using fairly typical cloud approaches means a good portion of it is reusable or a reasonable base for your own projects. https://lnkd.in/e3AKqCs#Go #golang #Gin Pooja Yadav,0

"Executive Order (EO) 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, 12 May 2021, directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to recommend minimum 
standards for software testing within 60 days. This document describes eleven recommen-
dations for software verification techniques as well as providing supplemental information 
about the techniques and references for further information. It recommends the following 
techniques: 
• Threat modeling to look for design-level security issues 
• Automated testing for consistency and to minimize human effort 
• Static code scanning to look for top bugs 
• Heuristic tools to look for possible hardcoded secrets 
• Use of built-in checks and protections 
• “Black box” test cases 
• Code-based structural test cases 
• Historical test cases 
• Fuzzing 
• Web app scanners, if applicable 
• Address included code (libraries, packages, services) 
The document does not address the totality of software verification, but instead recom-
mends techniques that are broadly applicable and form the minimum standards",0

"HOW TO START AN APP BUSINESS IN 10 STEPS (2)Step 3. Platform choice.In earlier years developers had to choose between Blackberry, Symbian, Windows Phone, iOS, Android. Now things got easier and you should seriously regard only the last three.In some way, even the last two, cause Windows Phone and apps for it couldn’t gain much popularity during the past few years. For instance, nowadays tens of millions of smartphones run Windows, compared to hundreds of millions on iOS and Android. And it doesn’t seem that things are getting better as lately, Windows was more concentrated on mixed reality.So we have Android and iOS devices left. There is a great difference between their app stores.If we look at statistics the image is quite clear. During the last years, Google Play remains a leader in annual downloads with 63 billion downloads in 2016. Third-party Android stores follow with 45 billion. At the same time, Apple App Store had only 29 billion annual downloads.However, the picture changes if we look at annual revenue. Here Apple remains the leader with 34 billion dollars in 2016. Google Play alone got 17 billion and third-party stores – only 10. Due to the experts in 2021, Apple will still remain the leader, although the combination of Google Store and third-party stores will exceed iOS even this year.Also, Apple App Store tends to have higher prices. So here you should think about your monetization strategy. If you’re going to sell your apps iOS will be a better decision, while Android apps can work better with an advertisement.By the way, we must also remind you about web applications. Those are quite universal and cheaper to develop. But they can’t fully compete with native apps and therefore we wouldn’t recommend them for starting your app business.Step 4. Development.After choosing a type of the app you can look for reliable partners to work with. Actually, this stage is more about team building. Depending on your goals you’ll need various coders, designers, copywriters or even photographers. The key thing here is to find people for long-lasting cooperation.You have few possibilities to find needed developers:Get an offshore freelancer.On services like Upwork or Guru, you can find the needed person. Competition between independent programmers is quite high, so rates there tend to be lower. However, their work usually takes more time and there is a risk that your app will not be ended or will have bugs.Also developing an app requires at least two people: one developer and one designer. If you hire freelancers there is a chance they wouldn’t be able to make a good team. Besides, remember that apps will also need support in future.TALK TO OUR TEAMWebsite: https://lnkd.in/gH7ajJSEmail: info@codelynx.io#softwaredevelopment#softwaredeveloper#softwareeducation#codelynx#codelynxdevelopmentapp#educationsoftware#partnership #cooperation",0

"When we choose a #wallet for holding cryptocurrencies, we often focus on press reviews and visual design. But the most important thing is what is inside the wallet ???There are 2 types of apps:??? Open source code?? Closed source code?Open source allows you to make sure that a wallet works as stated in the documentation. But if we use an application with closed code, then there are doubts about the transparency and of this wallet.?In #crypto, it is believed that the wallet should have an open-source code. It's necessary for convincing users of the safety of their funds ???The closed code indicates the lack of confidence of developers in eliminating all bugs. If you put such code on open resource, then in the case of error detection, a hacker can attack #app successfully??Why are closed-source #cryptocurrency wallets dangerous??The creators of such wallets don't take responsibility for the loss of user funds.

The developers of the wallet don't give direct explanations about the cases of hacking.?Another example is the multifunctional Electrum Wallet, whose outer look and convenience are less attractive for users, but it is significantly ahead of Exodus in security.?What to choose??Not convenient, but secure Electrum, which takes time to understand, or attractive Exodus, where all operations can be done in a couple of clicks.??? Probably most beginners will prefer Exodus, rather than spend time understanding the complex and incomprehensible Electrum.?FORSAGE recommends avoiding using closed source wallets. But if the desire is too great, then don't keep all crypto in one wallet, use it for small payments and transfers.?Next week, we will talk about the most secure wallets where you can store most part of your funds ??#forsage # #blockchain #cybersecurity #privacy #payments #dataprivacy #cybercrime #safety #money #job #jobseekersonly",0

"3 ?? Tips for creating a SaaS platform?????? 1?? Find an ideaResearch is one of the most important steps you should take to ensure the success of your SaaS product. While this recommendation may seem too trite to be useful, make sure you follow it.In our experience, the best way to do research is to have an idea. In the initial state, you may not have a concrete idea for the software you want to create. And the best way to find it is to look at yourself, your friends or family. This can give you a useful indication and help you develop a SaaS solution with which you can solve some of your or your loved ones' problems. Maybe you are currently working with a software application and you are not satisfied with the way it performs tasks. Maybe you think that this particular SaaS application can benefit from this or that feature. If you think like that, don't hesitate to take this opportunity, because chances are you're not the only one having problems with this software.2?? Validate the viability of your productOnce you have found the idea, you need to validate it. If you don't, other people can benefit from it. And you'll eventually find out that no one really wants it. The best way to validate the idea is to go check Facebook groups for Amazon, provided you intend to create an Amazon-based solution.It is also desirable that you produce a minimum viable product (MVP) and see how your target audience will react to your application. Some developers test their fundamental hypothesis, their assumptions without even creating the most basic version of a SaaS application. 3?? Attracting customersIf you want to launch your SaaS app business and gain more customers, consider doing the following.Get rid of your free plans. If your product has a lower price point, you might want to consider a trial model instead. As a result, you can see a significant increase in customer conversions by letting them try before they buy. This model improves the quality of leads and customers, while free plans tend to attract many people with questions and complaints.Shorten the trial period of your application. Most trials last 30 days. Yet some extend beyond 60 and even 90 days, which is not a good idea. Your customer won't discover anything about your software in four weeks that he couldn't discover in one. So make sure you don't delay your customer's buying decision with your misguided software trial policy. We've found that 14-day trials are enough to get your SaaS application to engage a prospect for a limited time. The short window of use encourages customers to add a greater sense of urgency to the purchase decision.Offer prepaid annual contracts. Give your customers the option to prepay the full value of the service year. Offer them a discount and take advantage of your revenue spike.#saas #startups #software #amazon #aws #mvp #crm #digitalagency",0

"The global ?????????????? market is expected to register a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of nearly 16.1% during the forecast period, 2021-2026, according to WBOC-TV.Let's take a look at what is currently relevant in the eHealth industry.? Telemedicine apps give remote doctor visits, and enhance the efficiency of medical service. This is convenient because patients save a lot of time for transportation, access to a library of diagnosis and treatment plans, can schedule an appointment and record calls, while the doctor has quick access to EHR. Plus, virtual visits are typically less expensive than in-person consultations.? Self-monitoring apps help to improve patient self-management and self-efficacy by monitoring and analyzing data during one treatment period, pregnancy or others. The tool comes with recommendations, improving medication-taking behavior, health services utilization, identification of adverse effects, overall health status, and patient satisfaction. These innovative technologies can be used with smartphone apps and smartwatches.? The Electronic Health Record (e-Health Record) is a modern version of a patient’s paper chart that collects and stores patients’ medical information from various providers (laboratories, pharmacies, school and workplace clinics, etc.) in a standard format via the e-Patient portal.Having all these, you can be calm, because all video calls, files, and other data are secured.These solutions are great examples of doctor apps that influenced this huge medicine modernization.

"In case you missed it, Adam Mosseri (Head of Instagram) gave an update last week on the future of the platform. It’s interesting to see such an open and honest approach to the development plans for Instagram.Here's a quick summary from our Head of Creative, James Pierechod.?? They are embracing the power of creatorsThis recognises the value of individuals (vs institutions) on Instagram and trying to help them make a living. We may even see a change in the algorithm and weighting for influencers to put more focus on the person, content and community.?? They are doubling down on mobile-first videoA bold statement and clear move away from being “just a square photo-sharing app”. With research proving that people use Instagram to be entertained, creating video content that’s immersive and truly engaging will be more important than ever.It also appears that Instagram want to shift more towards recommendations and suggestions (less about followers) – although we wonder how much this has been inspired by the rapid rise of TikTok.?? They are leaning into the change in shopping from offline to onlineNo surprise here, given how much the pandemic has accelerated the rate of change in commerce. Likely to see a ramp up in interactive connections and experiences in e-commerce (and we’re intrigued to see how that overlaps with video).?? They are looking more at messaging (over Feed and Stories)Probably a reference to the advertising and engagement potential of dark social (those interactions that can’t be fully tracked). The power of a recommendation is far greater in messaging than Feed or Stories, and we expect this will be supported by data from Facebook Messenger too.So, plenty to be aware of here. Of course, we’ll be keeping a close eye on how things develop and helping clients get the best out of it for their brand.We’d love to hear what you think about these changes – whether that's from your own experience, or the expectations of your brand and audience when using Instagram.",0
"At the beginning of this year, I was leaving my first job after ten years to become a full-time coach. This meant changing my living conditions and my lifestyle.In the meantime, I was also training for my first half Ironman race. I had too much on my plate and I knew I will need superpowers to navigate this challenging time.My fellow coaches suggested that I take the Positive Intelligence 6-Week-Program. I was skeptical at the beginning. It felt like your typical American recipe for success. The kind that you avoid without looking at it.However, because of the referrals, I decided to embark on this journey and it was truly transformational.The program is built on the concept of Saboteurs. The inner critic voices are constantly trying to sabotage you to reach your potential and goals. After identifying your saboteurs, it focuses on developing your inner sage or inner coach that tunes down the saboteur voices in your head.The great thing about the program is that you also have access to the PQ App, designed to measure your mental fitness throughout the six weeks. The app also offers daily reflections and coach challenges meant to keep you in the loop throughout the program.More about the science behind the app here: https://lnkd.in/eHEcGfHOne thing that I am grateful for is the overall sense of 'ease and flow' I developed during the program. Also on a more exact note throughout the six weeks I managed to:- Gain a better understanding of my limiting beliefs and patterns- Work on family conflicts that I was avoiding for a long time- Make a smooth transition from Marketing Coordinator to Transformational Coach- Land my first clients as a coach- Develop the mental muscles necessary for completing my first half Ironman raceThis might seem a lot but I truly believe that this program is effective. I especially recommend it to people who are multi-passionate, high-performing individuals looking for a personalized learning experience that will have a long-lasting impact on the way they work and live.Also, I am happy to share with you that starting of July, I am conducting this program as a PQ Coach. If you are curious about the mental fitness journey or you already decided to enter this program, feel free to contact me via message for further details and enrollment.#coaching #mentalfitness #positiveintelligence #easeandflow",0

"#Education TV in #Pakistan has been made available as on demand content on program websites, YouTube channels, and #mobile apps. #Punjab developed animated teacher characters for TV lessons (Miss DNA, Mr. Khawarizmi, and Miss Curie). “The biggest challenge was the disengagement of children from academic learning… The biggest question was—‘how will the children learn’? We started looking at what existed and what we could start immediately,” stated Umbreen Arif, Technical Advisor to the Pakistan Ministry of???? Federal Education and Professional Training, who led TeleSchool.Public school teachers, subject experts, and timetabling specialists were leveraged to develop TV lessons and scripts for broadcasting aligned to the national and provincial curricula, and to curate existing educational content. Teachers also supported mass communication campaigns by appearing on TV network morning shows.School closures as a result of the pandemic affected more than 30 million children in Pakistan, including approximately 12 million children in Punjab.  To ensure the continuity of #learning, the country turned to #educational technology (EdTech) tools like TV, #radio, and #mobile phones. Almost all of Pakistan (95 percent) and Punjab (90 percent) had access to TV, so this became the most viable option for #remote learning for students and for teacher training.A Gallup Pakistan Rapid Assessment was conducted in May 2020 to measure the short-term impact of #TeleSchool regarding awareness, viewership, perceived quality, and #loyalty. Within two months, 1,200 #households with children ranging five to fifteen years of age in Pakistan were telephonically surveyed: nearly one in every three Pakistanis surveyed said they had accessed TeleSchool lessons (with the highest proportion from Punjab), with an estimated weekly viewership of six million children. Seventy-seven percent were either satisfied or somewhat satisfied with TeleSchool #lessons, with #rural respondents more satisfied than their urban counterparts. 66 percent of parents surveyed said they would recommend TeleSchool to other parents.Source : https://lnkd.in/eig-Wj8",0

"Continuing from my 2nd post on NO CODE or LOW CODE Apps and Webpage Development....From 2nd post onwards, I will publish some Apps one by one, showing the possibilities of Apps developed with NO CODE or LOW CODEIn the 2nd post, I presented an Apps on work place safety. An example where Apps can be used internally, to assist EHS team when carry out safety audit, it also makes it easy for employee to report near misses or risk. Since it can be done on the spot, it save times of filling up forms, transfer the information to computer (Excel, or word or ..).  The data can also be presented in Pie / Bar Chart if required. Someone asks about the data, storage and etc. There are many NO CODE or LOW CODE Apps platforms available online. Each has their own way of handling the databases. The one I choose, use Google Sheet as the source of data. It means all data will be store in Google Drive. You can also use One Drive, Microsoft One Note and etc. Google Drive is just my personal preferences. The file size is not too much a concern here. However, I don’t recommend running database with too huge file size. My experience running nearly 10K rows of data in Google Sheet is still quite smooth. The features available will depend on whether you are using free or paid version of the platform. So far for my ex-company, we have been surviving with a free version for 1 year. Let’s continue with the next Apps I will be putting up here. It is a simple field service Apps where you can record field service activity so that we can, together will a simple field report. Below is the installation link or viewing link you can play aroundhttps://lnkd.in/gp7VmgtI have also including a short video on basically how the Apps looks likeAll these Apps can be customized to suit your own requirement once you have master on how to use the platform. If you are interested, you can message me for further discussion. For Demo Purpose – I have removed the login required and also other safety and access control features.",0

"During weekend catchup with few of my friends who work in traditional app build support, they were asking what I need to do to shift and jump start career in Data and AI.  #weforum  has predicted top 3 increase in demand are for Data Analysts, Data Science (AI,ML) and Data Engineers. https://lnkd.in/duNR9wW Nothing comes easy in life but here are few things you could from my perspective to be relevant in current world of #dataandai1.      Math and Mindset – Generate interest towards #math and apply analytical mindset in your day to day life. Data Analysts don’t approach a problem with preconceived mindset, we work with data to draw conclusion or recommend decisions. Always learn to ask questions before taking a stance.2.      Learn to code – It is critical to have ability to read, write, analyze #data and #code. In today’s world Data Engineers is one of the highest paid salary (even higher than Data Scientist in some cases). You can pick Python, Scala or any Cloud (AWS, Azure or GCP) to cross or up-skill yourself3.      Research, Experiment & Network – Analytics and AI can be applied in every field including health care, food industry, space etc. Pick your area of interest and do appropriate research of applicability, POV’s. Do experimentation on your own cloud accounts and connect with relevant people in the field to hear and learn real experiences.4.      Skill development – Data Analytics is not just coding, you can be an Analyst, product owner, Sales executive, Functional SME, Statistician and many more. Until you have an appetite to understand the data and contextualize the information to your area then you have a role to play.5.      Education – Having right education will help enormously if you are starting your career just now or even trying to change. Universities are offering full time courses, short certifications in various fields of Data Analytics. Having one of these along with any cloud certifications will provide ton of confidence for yourself.Thomas Alva Edison once said – Opportunity is missed by most people because it comes dressed in overalls and looks like work. #dataandanalytics #ai #dataengineering #machinelearning #datacareer #carreer #aravsays",0

"The series ""Our favourite tools for online training"", continues with Robert Klein's digital flip charts. He says: ""Over the last couple of months, I needed to find a good tool for online facilitation. Although I am not an artist I always liked to work with flip charts and visualize content of my workshops. The challenge was to find a tool which can be used to write digitally, now as well as, for upcoming in person trainings after the corona pandemic.For me, Procreate is it!An easy to use app which can be used for creating flyers as well as a digital flip chart during the online workshop. As added value, the generated posters can be sent to a printing house and used for live-in-person session when needed. It's perfect for both worlds: remote and in-person workshops which reduces the workload quite a bit.The app is easy to use and my participants like to be part of the just-in-time development of content. The look is fresh and can be easy adjusted for different groups and customers. Knowing that I probably use only 10% of the Procreate potential I can really recommend the app. It helped me a lot to stay motivated, develop new things and try a different approach.""#moveonMonday #online #training",0

"Supply Chain Hack- Demystified #DeadlyhackThe recent Solar Winds hack is unique, very clever, deadliest and one of its kind.Solar Winds is an networking product.  Probably it gathers the health of nodes/computers and tries to present them in a dashboard. Such tools also have hot fixes, Updates/Upgrades, like any software app.The clever thing in this hack is that the hacker exploits the trust that network admins have to Auto approve and accept, change that come from Solar Winds/ Similar apps. This is the reason it's called supply chain hack. A true ""Trojan Horse"".Another devilish uniqueness, is that the viral payload is very small and it gets inserted at the very last step in the software build process just before the checksum seal is stamped on the build #software. Making detection a big challenge.https://lnkd.in/d5U8P8W. Thanks to NPR. I drew my understanding about this from NPR and security wonks like Shakthi Sivaramakrishnan, CISA, CISM Once infected, it gives the perpetrator the power to choose to release the attack vector, any time in future. Like invoking a sleeper cell.Now how does one protect themselves from such hacks?The answer is ""Zero Trust"". Basically you should not trust even your own wife!!! :-). Any software update by any vendor in your eco- system,  should be quarantined and thoroughly checked before giving authorization for Update/ Upgrade. This path is not without Risks, and would call for big process changes. But yes we can mitigate future attacks.As they say, if there is a will there's a way. #kudos to our President Biden and Whitehouse to strategize and come up with recommendations for companies to follow. Now all vendors of Federal Government are under vigilant hawk eye before they are allowed to sneeze??.Pun intended..in these covid times...he..heBut I am still looking for answers on how to detect if you are already infected. The hacker sleeper cell is already part of you. Then what???Such attacks will need $$ and muscle to develop. I deplore all Nation States who takes this cudgel to refrain from such activities. $$$ (CEO's/ CIO's please note and open your wallets and eqiup your ISRM folks to safeguard your company)In my view  this is the nuclear option in cyber attacks.So friends nothing is safe anymore.

"Benefits of  4 Customer Engagement Metrics for your Business.1. Customer Satisfaction ScoreAlmost 80% of marketers want to prioritize improving customer retention and satisfaction. Start tracking your customer satisfaction score (CSAT). The CSAT will determine how pleased customers are with a product or service.You can measure the CSAT by using questions from a customer feedback survey.In some ways, the CSAT is similar to the net promoter score (NPS). The NPS measures loyalty, though. CSAT, as the name suggests, measures satisfaction.When developing a customer survey, you can ask, “How would you rate your overall satisfaction with our service?” Most companies create a scale:Very UnsatisfiedUnsatisfiedNeutralSatisfiedVery SatisfiedTo calculate your average, look at the number of satisfied and very satisfied customers. Then, divide that total by how many responses you received.2. Net Promoter ScoreYour Net Promoter Score (NPS) can tell you how likely a customer would recommend a product to their friends. A strong NPS could indicate a strong word-of-mouth marketing strategy. A product recommendation could help you reach new customers.It could also indicate brand loyalty with your existing customers.Loyalty is sometimes worth 10 times as much as a single purchase, too. Meanwhile, 60% of consumers prefer to purchase from familiar brands.Improving your brand relationships can boost retention rates, improving your ROI.You can calculate this metric as you engage consumers using in-app surveys.NPS equals the percentage of people eager to promote your business (promoters) minus those who aren’t (detractors).3. Churn RateChurn rate is a user engagement metric. It’s the percentage of clients who cut ties from your brand during a given period. The lower your churn rate, the more customers you retain.A lower churn rate could indicate a strong customer experience. It could also indicate your marketing efforts are excelling.Otherwise, you need to determine why, where, and when your customers disappear.You can calculate your churn rate by subtracting the number of clients at the end of a cycle from the initial number of clients. Then, divide that by the number of clients at the beginning of the time period. Multiply by 100% to get your total.The lower the churn rate, the higher the retention rate. This indicates satisfactory customer engagement.4. Customer Lifetime ValueThe Customer Lifetime Value (CTLV) measures the amount of revenue you can expect from a client during the span of your relationship. The longer a client continues purchasing from your business, the higher their CLTV.To calculate CLTV, you need to first determine the lifetime value. LTV equals the average purchase value multiplied by the number of transactions. Then, multiply that total by the retention time period.To calculate CLTV, multiply the LTV by the profit margin.Aderonke Salami Seun Odegbami Idowu Ayeni (SSGB) (ISO Certified)",0

"Today, I'd like to share a couple of personal development/growth insights with all of you that I've recently acquired.The first insight I acquired is a productivity & notetaking system called ""Notion"" that I'd highly recommend to anyone looking to become more organized in their personal and/or professional lives (if not already doing so).I'm still very new to the system, but I've gone through many videos on it and how different people use it (content creators and working professionals), and I've started building out my own.  Additionally, to help incentivize trying/using it, if you're still in school and have access to a school email account (.edu), you can get the Personal Pro access for FREE for as long as you have your school email account.  And, even if you don't have such access, the Personal Pro plan is actually very cheap, and I'd say very worth it.That all aside, if you're interested in learning more about ""Notion,"" I'd suggest that you check out two YouTubers' videos on it to learn more:•  Thomas Frank >>> (https://lnkd.in/eWyATMA)•  Ali Abdaal >>> (https://lnkd.in/ehdx_DZ)The second insight I acquired is the concept of using an ""automated flow system"" for content/information consumption.  This ""system"" is essentially a digital method by which you log and review content and insights you've acquired through watching things on YouTube, reading articles and posts online, or listening to podcasts (as the most common examples).Most if not all of us ""consume"" mass amounts of content/information daily, but I don't know many (including myself) who have an effective method of ""properly"" capturing and reflecting on what we learn; this is a cognitive trap known as ""overconsumption,"" whereby we keep consuming information each day to the point that we retain very little (if any) of most of it, which results in waste of effort and time.  Again, this is where an ""automated flow system"" designed to help us capture and reflect on what we learn/consume would help.And, in order to effectively use such a system, we obviously have to reduce the friction between what it is and how it integrates into our daily lives; enter Ali Abdaal (once again) with the five tools he uses and how he automates them all ""dumping"" into what's known as a ""Second Brain.""That said, Ali would be able to explain this far better than I presently can, so feel free to check out his video (linked below) if you have about 11 mins to spare.And lastly, as always, I wish you all the best in your personal and professional journeys, and I hope you have a great week!!#neverstoplearning #productivity #clearmindclearlife",0

"How to raise the adoption rate of #sustainablemobility apps in France? This is the question Cyrille TETOUGUENI and I had the privilege to study while interviewing 30 industry experts, on behalf of BNP Paribas & the Movin'On Connect Community.We noticed 4 Trends affecting greater speed of maas:(TLDR: B2C Maas is a blood bath. Governments should work directly with businesses to solve for distribution with lower CAC:  A G2B2C Franchise Model).1. B2C would be an absolute bloodbath in France due to a highly fragmented competitive landscape of all the mobility players (Tier, Velib, Lime, Bus, Train etc all competing for the same consumer dollars.2. Mobility service providers were expanding horizontally to include multiple transportation options. Eg. Uber listing public transport options (frienemy relationship?). But there was no app that was truly taking care of the customer experience -like Amazon where I could buy a bunch of ticket 'products' with a single payment. 3. Deep linking vs. Deep integration appeared to be a major defensibility mechanism. In ecommerce it was the equivalent of committing to a channel management strategy or simply leaving a affiliate link on someone else's site and developing your own brand.com. The answer is both channels have to be robust to capture as many users as possible! But mobility still very siloed in France. Indicator of a hyper fragmented and newish landscape.4. Data privacy is a major blocker between mobility mash-ups of public transportation x private MSPs. Public transportation actors are reluctant to open up their backdoor to anyone (though in Nordic countries, full business competition is encouraged). For public actors, it appeared that owning the end user was important since the want to demonstrate tax payer value through mobility. Proposed SolutionTo encourage lower CAC (customer aquaition costs) & better UX we recommended a G2B2C Franchise Model - where the public player acted as Franchisor, ie. App + brand owner+standards setting. They licenced out the product to the ""B"": Employers & Residential managers (or a third party who can manage it) in exchange for distribution to their employees/residents, brand equity, data standards, sustainability goals. Like this Gov' could do what they do best: Financing and setting the rules! Without having to worry about distribution. As for biz, it would be cheaper than building on your own app because the gov' contract has the benefit of scale to negotiate lower rates with the tech provider. Biz would also be able to crack the iron wall of public transportation - having access to ticketing back-end here that, so far has been exclusive only to public transport apps making a much more seamless UX for the 30m employees in France. Lastly, it would be a plug and play solution equipped with everything you need to get that tax break. Only 20 pages left of a report and I'm done my MBA!  Looking forward to your feedback here, and thanks to everyone today!",0

"You might not have heard about the secure messaging app called ""Wickr"".  ??It is not famous as its counterparts like Telegram or Signal, but it has been an important player in the secure messaging platform for a long time. From the day I began my quest looking for a secure messaging app; Wickr was constantly recommended everywhere. In fact, it is featured in the hacking/thriller TV series Mr. Robot as the messaging platform used by the characters. In real life, it used by general public, journalists, activists and even criminals! Amazon acquiring Wickr is an interesting development. It seems that Amazon is now getting its feet wet in the messaging world too! This would help Wickr to get more popular now that this Tech Giant is running it.

"Fast - Accurate - SimpleYou select two out for performance optimization. The temporary malfunction of a crypto app is a good example for fast and simple choice. Look at the trillion dollar smile over night, even if it's a fault signal. The accuracy is not necessary important in client and investor minds because they have low tolerance for consistency in development process, especially, an app could involves a certain number of specialized developers/software engineers. Normally, there's a saying ""numbers lie"".That doesn't mean all crypto app is bad performance or lacking work ethic. Personally, I am not investing into crypto since the born of Bitcoin notice so no recommendation of a secured platform to name here.From analytics background - benchmarking and performance evaluation of the Area Under Curve (AUC) work, this type of malfunction is wild because your (business) model supposes to perform around 95 percentage and above over time. In business statistics, confidence levels of 90/95/99% are frequently used.Typical user requirement would be smooth operation and ""when will I get the minimum viable product (production deployment), how about in two weeks!?""If you're in such project, you should ask ""do you have a lawyer to handle a risk of getting in a lawsuit?""Write your terms and conditions of using the app service carefully.",0

"A really interesting look at three startups that are ""reinventing social media"". An insightful piece that sheds light on where social is (potentially) headed. Via 'Digital Native' newsletter.TL;DR*** BeReal is a Paris-based startup that’s taken France by storm over the past few months. As the name suggests, the app is all about being real: every day at a random time, you’re given two minutes to capture a photo of what you’re doing. *** Poparazzi launched last Monday and debuted at #1 on the App Store. The app’s premise is simple: you take photos of your friends, and they take photos of you. Your profile shows both pictures you’ve “popped” of friends and pictures your friends have popped of you.*** Dispo’s tagline is “Live in the Moment”. The app replicates the concept of a disposable camera. You open the app and take photos, then wait for the photos to “develop” at 9am the next day.Want to dig deeper?

"Hello AllHope you all are doing great.Last week we caught up with some really interesting updates on top platforms like Google, Instagram, etc. So don’t forget to check those 8 updates if you haven’t already.And with a new week comes new updates, so here are this week’s1. Instagram launches test of video and image uploads from the desktop versionAfter developing for a few months, Instagram has now launched the live test of its video and image upload options via the platform's desktop version. The option is currently available for a small group of people who have access to the entire publishing suite. This update will streamline the publishing process for brand/social media managers, making it easier for them to take posts live directly from their systems.2. Instagram is testing content recommendations within the main feedLast year, Instagram added a ""suggested posts"" listing at the end of a long scroll on your Instagram feed. After testing this for quite some time, the platform, based on the response and engagement with the recommended content, is now looking to highlight and display more accounts, topics, and posts of interest. According to The Verge, ""Suggested posts will be mixed throughout your primary feed, sometimes ahead of photos and videos from people you follow."" Along with this, Instagram is also adding new control options with which users can add or remove topics of interest.3. Facebook rolls out live audio rooms and in-stream podcast playback in the USBoth Live Audio Rooms and Podcasts have been in testing on Facebook for a while, and now, the social media platform has officially rolled out Live Audio Rooms and in-stream Podcast discovery and playback within the app.4. Twitter announces the launch of the option of sharing Tweets to Instagram Stories for iOs5. Facebook tests Reels and Rooms display within the Facebook appFacebook is looking to boost accessibility to Reels and Rooms, and in the wake of this, the platform is testing the display of Reels and Rooms within the Facebook app. Facebook is currently testing the display of Reels and Rooms right above its Stories panel, where users would be given two options - Reels and Rooms - they can tap on.6. Google rolls out new ""Spam Algorithm"" updateGoogle confirms the rollout of a spam-related algorithm update on June 23rd, 2021. Google's Danny Sullivan confirms an algorithm update targeted at fighting spam is rolling out to search results. Exact details were not provided about this specific update.

Google is now showing ""Reliable Sources"" prompt on Trending SearchesGoogle is showing a new prompt on trending searches when there aren't enough reliable sources.

"The high price of Context Switching For Makers & Ways to Avoid ItMakers and Developers don’t like to be interrupted. Ever wonder why? Well, the one-line answer is, “Context Switching is super hard!”?? Context switching is expensiveSwitching contexts has a very high cost on people who do deep work. Jason Heeris illustrates with an interesting example what damage a simple ping can do to the developer’s flow.https://lnkd.in/eV9pZUs?? Cost of interruptionsChris Parnin looked at the cost of interrupting developers, and made some powerful observations:?? A programmer takes between 10–15 minutes to start editing code after resuming work from an interruption.?? An interrupted task is estimated to take twice as long and contain twice as many errors as uninterrupted tasks.?? A programmer is likely to get just one uninterrupted 2-hour session in a day.?? Meetings are the biggest source of interruptionsAs Paul Graham wrote in his seminal 2009 essay:“A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in. Plus you have to remember to go to the meeting. For someone on the maker's schedule, having a meeting is like throwing an exception. It doesn't merely cause you to switch from one task to another; it changes the mode in which you work.”?? Techniques to minimize context switchingWe can find flow in the world of constant interruptions. Here are some approaches, used by the most productive developers across the world, that we like:?? Time blockingDivide your workday into blocks of time. Each block should have the goal of completing a specific task.?? Time batchingDoing similar tasks together in a batch reduces context switching and increases efficiency. Eg. Doing all code reviews together, or answering all emails and slack messages together once or twice a day.?? Turning off notifications during deep work??

"If you are a Java developer and looking for a cross platform, open source solution I recommend that you try Codename One @ https://lnkd.in/ewp4T8eI have been looking for some time for a solution to build my own projects. I have gone out of my way really, by trying e.g. React, React Native, but the node.js linux style ""mess"" with all the dependencies and having to debug packages before I even start a project, is not for me.I have not yet tried Flutter, although I have it in my list. Yet, I prefer the language I have studied into, Java. Therefore, I am very happy that I managed to install and launch a ""Hello World"" basic mobile app in literally no time.Linux people, do not misunderstand me. I like Linux a lot, but when it comes to developing, I am used to a tidy environment where I may be 100% sure that things work. However, Javascript is not my main development language, so there is always a chance that I am missing something. It should not be that way though. This is the bottom line point I am trying to make here.This is my referral url in case you want to sign up using that:https://lnkd.in/emJe_Jr#crossplatform #java #mobile #tablet #ios #android #development",0
"After four years of chipping away, we finally secured a resolution to grant permission for a detached dwelling, at a rear garden to serve Supported Living. Unanimous approval at Test Valley’s Southern Area Committee, overcoming two failed pre-apps, followed by an unproductive planning meeting, withdrawn application, resubmitted revised scheme, refused application on design, dismissed at appeal. However the Planning Inspectorate agreed the siting of the proposed dwelling was considered acceptable and the design would enhance the character of the area. Armed with the Inspectorate‘s response the Free Go application to consider the outstanding matter of Parking & Nitrates mitigation, saw unanimous committee approval despite overwhelming local objections led by the parish council. All this for one dwelling! One would be mistaken for thinking we were proposing a major development! We can take comfort from the Inspector’s Appeal response disagreeing with the Local Authorities views on design and recognised the development was cited within the settlement Boundary. Only nitrates and parking remained as the subject of the application, all other considerations met and an officer recommendation for approval at committee. Our thanks to the team for the hard work involved and those who supported our application. The determination and perseverance of all including heavy campaigning by the applicant, will be at the benefit of residents with Asperger who have desperately required much needed accommodation for supported living, will help young people’s development of social skills, guide their interests and contribute to the local community, in a quiet rural setting; an important factor with this level of quality care for a calm relaxed environment. PAL Primary Access Care ltd is a preferred provider of Supported Living by Hampshire County Council, working collaboration with MENCAP dealing with mental illnesses, physical and learning disabilities.

"I remember catching a first glimpse of our “Home” app like 3 years ago. Around that time, Caitlin joined Xplor Education and started pushing more content to LinkedIn. I’m not a parent and had little idea of what Xplor did. Back then it was just another start-up to me but seeing that first product demo truly impressed me. The UI looked great and you could tell how useful Home would be for parents to have on their phones. Fast forward, I know a little bit more about Xplor, duh ;) Our product suite has come a long way and has never been better. Every Friday I join our town halls and showcases and I’m blown away by what our teams build – week after week. Our latest addition to our platform is going to be a game-changer for many. We just added Parenting Content – That’s basically Netflix for parents. They can now explore a library of educational content about their child's development. We’ve got videos, articles and podcasts that range across 9 themes for them to browse: Nutrition, Behaviour, Communication, Sleep, Growth & Development, Toileting, First-Aid & Safety, Dad's & Partners, Parenting & Work. Parents can also view content recommended by their child's educators. Couldn’t be prouder to be part of the team that is constantly trying to make education better. If you’re an Xplor user and haven’t updated your app yet, please check out the Google Play or iOS App Store.#wearexplor #parentingcontent #lifeatxplor #earlylearning #childcare",0

"If a company wanted to get started with using Robotic Process Automation (RPA), where & how should they begin? https://lnkd.in/eQYrHUMHave you heard of RPA? That is basically software that makes use of ML & AI to do routine manual SCM activities like process a Purchase Order. These processes tend to be manual, tactical, & clerically driven. However, that RPA software is learning from itself on how to do things better, faster, & cheaper. For example, RPA could start saying things like: I think we are paying too much, I think we should be using a different supplier, I think we are ordering in the wrong quantities, etc. The RPA software might actually decide to reopen the contract & have suppliers rebid on the business & the RPA might actually pick the new supplier. Yes, there will likely be human intervention for any activities that are “strategic”.For me, tactical means all the day to day operational grunt work. Strategic to me means the decisions that have to be made with longer term implications & consequences. I have a former student who went on to become a technology consultant & I asked him: if a company wanted to get started with using RPA, where & how should they begin in general? See his response below. Let’s just say the student has become the teacher.Hi Sime: Here are some points on how to approach a new technology investment, based on what I have seen in software & professional services:1. Have a very specific use case for implementing RPA. This requires research on behalf of your company. If you approach it with a general attitude that says, “Let’s have robots do all the work”, you will end up paying a consulting firm loads of money to evaluate your business for RPA opportunities, only to hear them tell you what you could have figured out on your own.2. It would be better to research industry peers to see what they are doing with RPA, THEN engage a consulting firm to help you implement an RPA solution that is focused on specific business processes.If you are looking for general help with where to start on RPA, I would advise against outsourcing the research to consulting/tech firms. It would be best to engage a consulting/tech firm for the implementation of an RPA solution, but not for general advisement on where to start. Most high-level assessments are overly priced in my experience & do not add much value. RPA is a cool technology but I have seen limited adoption with the mid-market companies I work with. It seems more popular with the Fortune 500 because they can afford the investment. In my opinion, companies of ALL sizes would get more value investing in integration solutions rather than RPA. Integrating disparate systems is a problem that all companies face, & I believe it’s a problem of greater importance than automating repetitive tasks.I have also had several people ask me about “Industry 4.0” or “Supply Chain 4.0” or “Digitization” of the Supply Chainhttps://lnkd.in/eZfHNqy",0

Playing around with RPA Challenge and dynamic selectors.The challenge is to input data from Excel file into the fields of a web form.Sounds easy no ? but wait !

"#artofprocurement: Buyer’s Attitude for Gratitude The day before yesterday, I was undertaking a session on ""Efficient processes in Procurement"" for Power Mech Projects, Hyderabad and during my discourse, I realized how blessed and empowered we all procurement people are.We understand a business by taking it apart and putting it back together again from the bottom up and the top down. We enjoy the bounty of unbelievable network of suppliers and service partners that are required to make a chain of shops run, build a ship from scratch, get a new vaccine through trial and to markets, or help design the best new gadgets for sale.We all need to imbibe the attitude of gratitude that make us operate from a place of abundance and courage instead of a cavern of scarcity and fear. Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos into order, and confusion to clarity. This is what we want to implement!Gratitude raises your happiness quotient and your mental and emotional health improves; we can take better, informed decisions, and maker lesser mistakes. Moving with gratitude helps you concentrate on what you have, you’ll always have more. If you concentrate on what you don’t have, you’ll never have enough; an old adage from our scriptures.10 years back, we were talking about procurement transformation (not a digital one). We talked about negotiation, supplier relationships, risk, and collaboration. And now, we’re still talking about the same. Now through the help of AI, machine learning, and RPA.Did we fail?Over the last decade, has procurement failed in the mission to change, grow, and evolve?Delved deep inside myself and I heard the voice “We haven’t failed!” We’ve simply refused to stop pushing. We’ve succeeded so often, and in so many ways, that it become a habit. Procurement is an iterative effort, driven by passionate individuals who give everything from within. Can you imagine what we would look like if we had ever declared our journey done? We’d still be analyzing line items in spreadsheets and manually processing orders; tactical activities would only be our jobs.Procurement faced a lot of challenges in 2020. We didn’t like everything we had to do to make it through the year in one piece, but we did it anyway. More importantly, we learned from it. And we showed the world that we can come out with shining colorsWe are so lucky to have our jobs as critical, fascinating, measurable, and expanding. So, take a minute today, and every day going forward, to be grateful that you are a procurement professional.????: Help me in my job search by tagging me to the job announcements. ????-???????????????????? | ???? ??????????’ experience | ?????????????????????? | with ???????????????????????? and ?????????????????????????? | at Tata Projects, L&T, Reliance Industries, DLF Cement, Mahindra",0

"First, the pandemic led to a loss of revenue for many companies, and implementing an RPA solution can help them to identify issues with existing processes so they can recover lost revenue. In the future, organizations can also use RPA to further reconfigure and improve procedures to move forward with greater efficiency.Second, empowering accounts payable (AP) staff to work more efficiently will be critical for post-pandemic recovery. By implementing RPA, businesses can automate and streamline AP processes, which means employees will no longer need to spend time on tedious data entry or other manual processes.In addition, all businesses are looking for ways to save money as they continue the recovery process and automation is vital for doing just that.https://lnkd.in/dbkeA9ZCredits: The Record#CobuildLab #Technology #Automation #Business #DigitalTransformation #RPA",0

"Deutsche Telekom AG is a German telecommunications company headquartered in Bonn and by revenue the largest telecommunications provider in Europe. For many years, Deutsche Telekom has featured among Fortune 500 companies with its latest ranking 86 in 2020. The business experienced swift and significant results over the last years and became one of the biggest RPA users in Europe as it scaled up RPA automation in different lines of business.By 2018, with seven different RPA platforms and seven different libraries to maintain, the business began to experience issues at scale. The complex nature of this automation setup meant that a single change in the main CRM system led to change requests on four different RPA platforms. Due to the nature of RPA technology, it could not be easily combined with different tasks – such as manual task – or RPA technologies from different vendors, Deutsche Telekom began to experience major problems as it looked to implement end-to-end processes.For more https://lnkd.in/gG7k4ha #automation #rpa #ai #digitaltransformation #europe #telecommunications #data #technology #rpabots",0

Many business leaders have already seen what RPA can do and are looking to implement it in their teams, departments, and entire companies. The best way to effectively implement RPA in your organization is to know the RPA software lifecycle. In this article, we give you a holistic overview of all the different stages RPA software undergoes to help you implement it systematically. Next, we share some best practices for implementing RPA to ensure that your journey to Robotic Process Automation is smooth and successful.https://lnkd.in/ea-Zxwr#automation #rpa #digitaltransformation #software #business #roboticprocessautomation #robotics #bankingindustry #banking",0

"???? ?????? ???????? ???? ???????????????????????????? ???? ?????? ???????????? ?????? ?????????? ???? ???????????????? ???????????????? ?????? ????????????????????I was asked about areas that I saw as great targets for RPA / AI / ML  the other day.For me Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) is an area that is almost a no-brainer.In the slides you can see the Gartner who's who for CLM.I'm assuming that we all are on board with the benefits of CLM, it isn't a new concept but I have seen many examples of challenges around the successful implementation.I believe the usage of RPA / AI / ML may be a game changer here.If you look at how each of these solutions is focussing their development, they are all utilising AI for some / all of the bottlenecks in the process.We can make the process more efficient, automating the contracting process, creation, approval etc.We can make the process more integrated, automatically measure usage against the specification or expectations of the contract clauses and propose changes based on risk and spend.We can anticipate renewals and position with the stakeholders and suppliers to anticipate intelligently.I revisited a great article by Amenallah Reghimi of JAGGAER which also links to the Gartner magic quadrant by Patrick Connaughton, Kaitlynn Sommers, Marko Sillanpaa & Jim Murphy  both of which are well worth a read (links in comments).???????? ?????????? ???????????????? ???? ?????? / ???? / ???? ???????? ?????? ???????? ???? ???????#procurement #supplychain #innovation",0

"Men’s grooming has come a long way from basic ‘manscaping’. Thanks to advances in hair science, more and more men and women are taking control of their hair loss with hair loss solutions such as medications, as well as hair transplantation.The procedure is quick (walk in and out after a few hours), minimally invasive and produces the hairline you used to have or always dreamed of. As we place our best face forward for online meetings and reunions, it’s important to feel confident about how to present ourselves. Here’s why now might be the best time to finally take action on your hairline.Distance doesn’t mean inconvenient- book a virtual hair loss consultation now and speak to a doctor about your hair loss problems.1. Work and recover from homePreviously, getting a hair transplant meant a 3-5 days off work and a series of explanations to colleagues about your absence. Older styles of hair transplantation (FUE or FUT) can be invasive and painful. However, the latest advancement in hair restoration is the Direct Hair Implantation (DHI) technique, which allows for faster recovery. Most patients can return to computer-based work as early as the next day. Some even answer urgent emails during the procedure itself!The recovery phase is easy and comfortable, 3 days of mild swelling then a progressive return to exercise and outdoor activities. At one week post-op, patients can resume light exercise and by two weeks post op, the recovery is complete, and patients can return to full exercise, including contact sports, swimming and haircuts.2. Luxury you can wear 365 days of the yearGalas, events and travel are on a temporary pause. These days, our hair is our best expression of how we feel, the fashion, and our personality. The shift in consumer spending to self-care has seen more and more men and women looking to finally treat our skin, hair and bodies with mini-luxuries where we can. With the lower halves of our faces (and bodies) concealed for the foreseeable future, adding more on top has never been a better investment.As our hair hero Jun Sunga put it, ‘divide the investment by the number of years you expect to enjoy it, and the decision is easy’.@robsoncosta – international model, DHI Philippines / @Robbycarmona- style icon, DHI Philippines3. Virtual hair loss consultations, wherever you areClinique de Paris has made the digital transformation to adjust and adapt quickly and safely. We set up virtual consultations to allow patients to discuss their hair loss concerns with trained consultants and doctors. This means more privacy, more answers, and less exposure. Patients just send photos of their problem areas (to info@dhi-philippines.com), and the specialist will immediately diagnose your condition and offer a tailored treatment plan. This helps to find truth amongst the fake news, so you save money, time and your hair.Separating false news and expert advice is important- speak to a professional to save time, money and your hair.",0

"When I tell people I work in the Tech Industry, they assume I am a programmer, a data analyst or someone Technical who contribute to the creation of a product. Not quite, but working in the Commercial department, I contribute to the sale of this product or service, so it's also very exciting!Since I joined the Tech Industry, I worked for companies selling complex products, CloudSense, a CPQ solution, Decibel a digital experience platform and now at VRP Consulting, I must learn about our own products and services but also Salesforce's (thank you Trailhead).As an SDR or even now as an Alliances Manager, I was never asked to do a deep dive in the product but I was always curious and wanted to have a better understanding of the features and capabilities. Not only it would help me get better at my job but it also felt empowering to increase my knowledge.When we started the onboarding of our new partner Docomotion and the training of our consultants to become champions, I realised quickly that if we wanted the sandbox to be configurated properly to enable my team to complete the exercises, I would have to step up and complete the training too so I could get the right features added and understand the pain points of my colleagues.I am so proud that even without a technical background, I managed to complete the tasks given and become a Docomotion Certified Expert! This is the first real evidence that I am able to add more strings to my bow and expand my skills in the Tech Industry.Thank you David Alon and the Docomotion team for the praise when completing the exercise and I am looking forward to obtaining my Champion certificate. :) Do you think Sales people should allocate more time into the learning of the complex capabilities of their products? Or is it something to leave to specialists? #techindustry #learningtechnologies #trailblazer #training",0

"For those who aren't yet aware, last year I enrolled in the UT Austin Boot Camp for full stack web development. I'm very excited to announce that I recently completed the program and am now ready to start applying for web developer positions!! ??Please take a look at my portfolio website, which I created from scratch using many of the skills and tools that I learned in the boot camp.?? Portfolio:  https://lnkd.in/et3zfigI've been working in health care as a registered dietitian for nearly five years now. While I have been successful in this career and am very proud of everything I've accomplished so far, I strongly believe my overall skills are much better suited for the tech field.One of the things that initially attracted me to health care was the desire to help others solve their (??nutrition-related) problems. However, it has become increasingly clear to me over the years that I thrive most when I'm helping people solve problems through the use of ??technology. For anyone who knows me well or has worked with me in some capacity, this will likely not come as a surprise. After all, I always seem to return to my love for computer technology when it comes to solving a variety of problems. This has been true throughout my career as a dietitian and throughout much of my life in general! For these reasons, I'm very excited to finally take this major step forward in my professional journey. Pursuing a career change after investing so much into my current career was a difficult decision for me. However, I'm a firm believer that it's never too late to pursue your passion.With all that being said, if you feel you're able to speak to my work ethic and/or skills, I'm kindly asking if you can help me with any of the following:? Post a recommendation to my LinkedIn Profile (I'll happily return the favor)? Add your endorsement to any professional skills that you feel is relevant (also on my LinkedIn profile)? Let me know about any potential job opportunities that you hear about, or pass along my info if you know someone hiring for a web developer position. I'm currently looking for positions throughout most of Texas and Florida, though a remote job would be ideal.? Let me help you with a small web project. I'm happy to volunteer my time to help in exchange for a recommendation/testimonial! ??? Like/share this post to help me get the word out. ??Thank you all in advance for any help you can provide. Over the years, many of you have offered to provide me with a professional recommendation when needed, and I greatly appreciate that as well.If you're a hiring manager interested in my work, then I would love to talk to you.

"I am not always an advocate of the most current #tech.  #Reactjs is currently powering nearly nine million websites worldwide.  WIth an estimated 200 million active websites, that means reactjs is running nearly 5% of the active internet at the time of this post (Y'all can fillet me if my math or stats are wrong).  Many of the projects we work on as a #freelancedeveloper do not require heavy libraries like reactjs.  Also, many of them use aging but mature technology stacks (hello php developers).  This being said, I have to admit I have been absolutely loving developing websites with #gatsbyjs and #graphql.  I feel that it is a front end framework that I will stick with for a while because it is both fast and has an awesome plugin ecosystem baked in.  I am really appreciating the modularity of react and the ability to create rich, dynamic ""static"" websites using the graphql queries.  if you are a #webdeveloper, I highly recommend giving gatsbyjs a try for smaller projects.  Heck, it can even do more complex projects like e-commerce if you want.  I am looking forward to sharing this website and its awesome performance gains soon,  #fullstackwebdeveloper #jamstack #javascriptdeveloper #scss #reactdeveloper #reactjsdevelopment #webdevelopers #nodejsdeveloper",0

"We're currently looking for a PHP Developer to join our Tech Team https://bit.ly/3kr6r07 If you're wondering what the job looks like, let us introduce you to Silvia Carreño, our Product Owner: ? What are the dynamics and collaboration like between Tech and Product?We work as a very agile team, following the Scrum methodology with all its tools, and our daily meeting is one of my favorites. With remote work, it’s really useful to connect in meetings altogether, share comments, information… These daily catch-ups are very important in order to be aligned and remove impediments as fast as possible to keep a continuous outcome delivery flow. As a Product Owner, I like to focus on pains and work with the team to find the best solutions to issues that can come up when we work together in cross-functional teams. We are also bringing in OKRs in our Sprint Retrospective every 2 weeks to share the progress and see how new features built by the Devteam have an impact on corporate objectives.? What are the upcoming projects and priorities? We are in the middle of a very challenging year for Dev and Product at Degusta Box. We just released a full Backend refactoring and now our focus is on the User Profile to improve Customer Retention. We have challenging projects such as building a new frontend fed by a new API under construction; implement a new server architecture and apply technology changes to improve the capabilities; finishing unit tests for the Backend and start the functional for frontend/API; and optimize processes as recurrent payments, one of the most important automation for a subscription business. We aim to deliver new features with a customer-centric approach and retain our users with the best surprises inside the monthly box but also with the most useful utilities to give them autonomy and ease in how they buy new products and manage their subscriptions with Degusta Box.? Why would you recommend Degusta Box as a place to work? One of the things I like the most about working at Degusta Box is the collaborative environment, and how the company encourages us to have ownership and share our point of view. It’s a very important value for me, in order to not limit initiatives and ideas that can come from other departments and stakeholders, helping to pursue our mission as a company. Also, good vibes between departments and most of all with the Dev team is what keeps me loving my job.To apply: https://bit.ly/3kr6r07#degustabox #jobsinbarcelona #devjobs #techjobs #recruitingnow #developer",0

I recommend everyone to read it.A father said to his son ""You have graduated with honors, here is a car I bought many years ago. It is pretty old now. But before I give it to you, take it to the used car lot downtown and tell them I want to sell it and see how much they offer you for it.""The son went to the used car lot, returned to her father and said, ""They offered me Rs.70,000 because the said it looks pretty worn out.""The father said, now ""Take it to the pawn shop.""The son went to the pawn shop, returned to her father and said,"" The pawn shop offered only Rs.8000 because it is an old car.""The father asked his son to go to a car club now & show them the car.The son then took the car to the club, returned and told her father, "" Some people in the club offered 10 Lakhs for it because it's a Toyota Fortuner, it's an iconic car and sought by many collectors"".Now the father said this to his son, ""The right place values you the right way,"" If you are not valued, do not be angry, it means you are in the wrong place. Those who know your value are those who appreciate you....Never stay in a place where no one sees your value.#people #success #motivation #life #sales ...#coding #codinglife #coder #python #programming #javascript #css #developer #php #developers #android #webdevelopment #stackoverflow #script #errors #webdeveloper #java #machinelearnig #project #microsoft #vscode",0

"Both Wix and WordPress are great choices for website design. They both provide built-in features, templates, and add-ons that can be of use to many organizations. Users without technological experience are able to use these website building platforms without learning how to code. When comparing the two, it is a matter of which features you would like which we have described in our WordPress vs. Wix blog.Wix has limits to how much you can customize the appearance and functionality to the website. You're unable to add forms (CTA's) or featured images to blog posts on Wix. You're unable to switch your website template so if you decide to rebrand it may be tricky! And you can’t access or change the HTML of your site.Advanced users or businesses looking to get the extra edge features that WordPress offers may want to use WordPress for its content management system (CMS) features. Below, we take a look how to convert your Wix website into WordPress. Read More: https://bit.ly/3vV7xmQ",0

"Partly because of language barriers in Korea, Google's search engine was not optimized for solving the needs of Koreans back in the mid-2000s. That's when Korean search engines Naver and Daum(owned by Kakao) were successful at customizing content for Koreans before the advent of YouTube. Naver excelled with three signature products. The first one was Naver blog, the second one was Naver knowledge In(similar to Quora), and Naver cafe(which provides CMS and membership management functions). It has succeeded in curating News and Entertainment content in a uniform manner with rankings and comments. I believe Koreans really loved these features because these were ways to look into the minds of others within a similar boundary of culture. Naver has perfectly provided such functions which Google did not seem to provide. Also unlike Google's search engine policy, Naver's ranking system gives fewer points for old posts. That means you could get instantly searched for certain keywords in Naver. That was massive compensation within the context of the mid-2000s. Of course, one could argue that the authority of the domain(blog.naver.com) was guaranteed, so such result ranking is obvious. The problem was that Naver refused to be searched by the Google search bot.",0

"Move your brick and mortar business to online e-commerceOnline e-commerce platforms are essential if there is a likelihood to run an online e-commerce business. Whether you are a B2C or B2B traditional business, the right e-commerce platform will enable you to execute complex business functions online.Not only can you move the process of interaction with your prospects faster, but also you will minimise the human intervention of your staff and eliminate human mistakes.However, selecting an online channel is not as easy as it seems – it strongly depends on the items you are going to sell and the target audience. That’s why the best e-commerce system is the one that meets your business needs and requirements.Take a closer look at the e-commerce solutions available:? Fully-functional e-commerce sites: mostly this type provides companies with the ability to utilize ready-to-use ecommerce solutions such as Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, etc. that bring significant benefits. Not only are a variety of these CMS solutions open-source and free, but they also offer unlimited customisations for your e-commerce business.However, if ready-to-use CMSs lack the required features and functionality for the future solution, you can build your own custom CMS from scratch to meet your unique needs and requirements.?? You can integrate third-party solutions such as analytics, email marketing, workflow automation features, or payment gateway options. Whether you need to track the progress of your online e-commerce in real time, streamline the order process or make data-driven business decisions, integration capabilities provide real advantages.?? You can get customers’ insights by incorporating analytics to retrieve actionable customer data (names, e-mails) and analyze their preferences, likes and dislikes, to offer products based on their personalized needs.?? Only by delivering a more sophisticated experience to the visitors of your e-store can you get higher conversion rates.? Online marketplaces: these types of e-commerce stores don’t include purchasing a license – it’s quite easy to set up and maintain. All you need is to register and upload your products. However, online marketplaces have the pricing structure that means they can charge a commission on every item listed or sold while your profits or payments are usually delayed.? Social commerce networks: not only can you promote your traditional physically located business with social media platforms, but also they allow you to sell some products. What’s more, you can simply sync or embed your existing online e-commerce business into a social commerce site for selling. The disadvantage of social commerce networks is that you need additional resources to manage your online presence because they provide very limited tools for customisation.However, it’s worth noting that if you have enough time and financial resources, there’s no rule against selling on multiple e-commerce channels.",0

"I put together a guide comparing and contrasting the HubSpot CMS and WordPress CMS. When making the decision for electrIQ marketing about which CMS platform to go with, some of the key factors were:Ease of UseFlexible DevelopmentContent Creation that ScalesSupportAdvanced Website Testing (A/B and multivariate)Deep Integration with our CRMIn my decision-making process, I tried to take into account the various team members that would be using our CMS, from our development team all the way down to our content marketing team.TLDR: The biggest differentiator between HubSpot and WordPress is the ability to seamlessly integrate your CRM into your website, making things such as “dynamic” or “smart” content (where a button, form, module, or entire webpage changes dynamically based on the data you have on a contact in your CRM) possible. Even better, if a contact isn’t in your CRM yet, you can still utilize smart content with rules based on IP location, referral source, and more.#hubspot #hubspotcms #wordpress #cms #contentmarketing",0
